# Dailybot Featured

> **Requires `dailybot-cli >= 3.9.0`** with `dailybot featured …` commands. If missing, ask the developer to run `dailybot upgrade`.

**Featured** is private per-user personalization — star Forms, Automations, or Check-ins so they surface first in your dashboards. Not gated by paid Labels.

## When to Use

- List which entities the user has starred
- Star or unstar one entity
- Batch feature/unfeature after bulk selection

Entity types: `forms`, `automations`, `checkins`.

## Step 1 — Verify Setup

Read [`../shared/auth.md`](../shared/auth.md). Featured requires a user-scoped session or API key.

## Step 2 — Common commands

```bash
dailybot featured list --entity-type forms
dailybot featured set <entity_uuid> --entity-type checkins
dailybot featured set <entity_uuid> --entity-type automations --unfeatured
dailybot featured batch --entity-type forms --uuids uuid-1,uuid-2
```

Add `--json` for machine-readable output.

## Step 3 — HTTP fallback

```bash
curl "https://api.dailybot.com/v1/me/featured/?entity_type=forms" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DAILYBOT_CLI_TOKEN"
```

See [`../shared/http-fallback.md`](../shared/http-fallback.md).

## Non-Blocking Rule

If auth fails, warn briefly and continue the primary task.
