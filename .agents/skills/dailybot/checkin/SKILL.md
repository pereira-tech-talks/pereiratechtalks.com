# Dailybot Check-in

You help developers complete their pending check-ins (daily standups, weekly surveys, async rituals) through Dailybot. Check-ins are structured questionnaires set up by a team lead — each has a set of questions that the developer answers. This is distinct from free-text progress reports (handled by `dailybot-report`).

---

## Auth model — API key or login

Check-in commands accept **either** a Bearer login session (`dailybot login`)
**or** an org API key (`DAILYBOT_API_KEY`).
A login session is the same one used by the webapp — it scopes actions to the
acting identity's permissions and pending check-ins (the server resolves the
API key's owner).

If the developer has only an API key, check-in commands still work — the CLI
falls back to `X-API-KEY`. Prefer `dailybot login` for the human's own personal
pending check-ins. (Both credentials work —
`dailybot upgrade` or `dailybot login`.)

---

## When to Use

- "complete my check-in", "fill in my standup", "answer my dailybot"
- "what check-ins do I have?", "any pending standups?", "check-in status"
- "what does my standup ask?" / inspect a check-in's questions or schedule (`show`)
- "show my past check-ins", "check-in history"
- "edit / update my check-in answer", "reset / delete today's check-in" (`edit` / `reset`)
- "submit my standup for yesterday / for a specific date" (backfill / future-date)
- At the start of a work session when the developer wants to catch up on rituals

Do **not** use this skill for free-text progress reports — route those to
`dailybot-report` instead. Check-ins are structured questionnaires with
specific questions; reports are freeform updates.

---

## Step 1 — Verify Setup

Read and follow the authentication steps in [`../shared/auth.md`](../shared/auth.md). That file covers CLI installation, login, API key setup, and agent profile configuration.

**Additionally**, confirm at least one credential is present (a login session or an API key):

```bash
dailybot status --auth 2>&1
```

If the output shows a logged-in user session **or** a configured API key,
proceed. Otherwise guide them through `dailybot login` (see auth.md) or ask
them to set `DAILYBOT_API_KEY`.

If auth fails or the developer declines, skip and continue with your primary task.

---

## Step 2 — List Pending Check-ins

```bash
dailybot checkin list --json
```

This returns today's pending check-ins for the logged-in user.

### JSON output shape

```json
{
  "count": 1,
  "pending_checkins": [
    {
      "followup_name": "Daily Standup",
      "followup_uuid": "<uuid>",
      "template_questions": [
        {
          "uuid": "<question-uuid>",
          "question": "What did you complete yesterday?",
          "question_type": "text_field",
          "is_blocker": false,
          "index": 0
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Present check-ins to the developer

When check-ins are found, summarize them clearly:

> "You have **1 pending check-in** via Dailybot:
>
> 1. **Daily Standup** — 3 questions
>    - What did you complete yesterday?
>    - What are you working on today?
>    - Any blockers?
>
> Want me to help you fill it in?"

When no check-ins are found:

> "No pending check-ins right now. You're all caught up."

---

## Step 3 — Complete a Check-in

Once the developer wants to complete a check-in, you have two approaches:

### 3a. Gather answers from context (recommended for agents)

Use what you know about the developer's recent work to draft answers, then
confirm before submitting. This is the best experience — the developer
reviews and approves rather than typing everything.

> "Based on your recent work, here's what I'd submit for **Daily Standup**:
>
> 1. *What did you complete yesterday?* — "Shipped the auth refactor with full test coverage"
> 2. *What are you working on today?* — "Starting the payment integration"
> 3. *Any blockers?* — "None"
>
> **Should I submit these answers?** (yes / edit / skip)"

### 3b. Ask the developer for each answer

If you don't have enough context, ask for each answer individually:

> "For your **Daily Standup**:
>
> 1. What did you complete yesterday?"

Wait for each answer, then confirm before submitting.

### Submit via CLI (non-interactive)

```bash
dailybot checkin complete <followup_uuid> \
  -a 0="Shipped the auth refactor with full test coverage" \
  -a 1="Starting the payment integration" \
  -a 2=no \
  --yes
```

> **Timeout**: Allow at least 30 seconds for CLI commands to complete. Do not use a shorter timeout.

### Answer types — match the question, not your prose

Every answer is validated against its question's `question_type`. Read the types
first (`dailybot checkin show <followup_uuid> --json`) and answer accordingly;
the server rejects a mismatch with `400 ["response is not valid"]` and does not
say which question was wrong.

| `question_type` | Answer with | Example |
|-----------------|-------------|---------|
| `text` | Free text | `-a 0="Shipped the auth refactor"` |
| `boolean` | `yes`/`no`, `true`/`false`, or `1`/`0` | `-a 2=no` |
| `numeric` | A number | `-a 1=8` |
| `multiple_choice` | One of the question's `choices` labels | `-a 3="Blocked"` |

A blocker question is very often `boolean`, so answering it `"None"` or `"N/A"`
— the natural English answer — is rejected. The CLI converts your string to the
right JSON type; it cannot guess that `"None"` means `false`.

### CLI flags

| Flag | Short | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `--answer` | `-a` | `index=response` pair (0-based question index). Repeatable. |
| `--response-date` | | Target date `YYYY-MM-DD`. Defaults to today. Only works while the check-in is still **pending**; once today's response is submitted you can no longer backfill a past day from the CLI. |
| `--yes` | `-y` | Skip confirmation prompt. |
| `--json` | | Emit machine-readable JSON output. |

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | Success |
| `3` | Not authenticated — guide through `dailybot login` |
| `7` | User aborted the confirmation prompt |

---

## Step 3.5 — The full check-in lifecycle

Beyond `list` + `complete`, the CLI covers the whole check-in lifecycle. **Every
command below takes `--json` and works headless with an API key** — this is what
lets an agent do almost everything with check-ins from the terminal.

### Status for a day

```bash
dailybot checkin status [--date YYYY-MM-DD] [--json]
```

Each check-in with its **pending/completed** state for that day (default today).
JSON: `{ "date", "count", "checkins": [{ uuid, name, response_completed, ... }] }`.

### Inspect a check-in's questions & schedule

```bash
dailybot checkin show <followup_uuid> [--json]
```

Name, schedule (frequency / time / timezone), and every question with its type
and UUID. Use this to know **what** a check-in asks (and each question's `uuid`)
before completing or editing it.

### Browse response history

```bash
dailybot checkin history <followup_uuid> --days 7 [--json]
dailybot checkin history <followup_uuid> --from 2026-06-01 --to 2026-06-30 --json
dailybot checkin history <followup_uuid> --user <user_uuid> --days 30   # one participant
dailybot checkin history <followup_uuid> --search "deploy" --days 30    # keyword filter
dailybot checkin history <followup_uuid> --days 30 --page 2 --page-size 20
```

Responses over a date range (date, completed, answer summary). Check-ins are
team-wide, so this lists **every participant's** responses by default (unlike
forms, which default to your own). Pass `--user <uuid>` to narrow to one
participant — that filter is admin/manager only; a member always sees only their
own responses regardless of the flag.

> **`--user` takes a UUID, nothing else.** An email or a display name is
> rejected before the request with `invalid_user_identifier`. Resolve it first
> with `dailybot user list --json`.

> **Paging.** `--page` / `--page-size` / `--limit` return a single slice; with
> none of them the command walks every page. `--search` / `--grep` is a
> case-insensitive substring filter (max 256 chars, truncated client-side). See
> [`../shared/list-query-and-errors.md`](../shared/list-query-and-errors.md).

### Edit an existing response

```bash
dailybot checkin edit <followup_uuid> -a 0="Updated answer" --yes [--json]
dailybot checkin edit <followup_uuid> [--date YYYY-MM-DD]   # prompts each question with the current value
```

Overrides specific answers on the already-submitted response, then re-submits.
Use `dailybot checkin history`/`show` first to learn the question order.

### Reset (delete) a response

```bash
dailybot checkin reset <followup_uuid> [--date YYYY-MM-DD] [--yes] [--json]
```

Deletes your own response for a day (confirms first unless `--yes` / `--json`).

### Backfill (past) & future-dating

`complete` accepts `--response-date`; `edit` / `reset` / `history` accept
`--date` (or `--from/--to`). The server may refuse when the check-in disallows
it — the CLI maps the `code` to a friendly message (and includes it in `--json`
errors):

| `code` | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `previous_responses_are_not_allowed` | Backfill is disabled for this check-in |
| `future_responses_are_not_allowed` | Future-dating is disabled |
| `followup_not_allow_responses_before_trigger_time` | Too early (before the trigger time) |
| `user_is_not_a_followup_member` | You're not a participant |
| `responses_not_allowed_on_inactive_followup` | The check-in is inactive |
| `template_questions_version_conflict` | Questions changed — re-run `show` and retry |
| `response_date_format_is_invalid` | Use `YYYY-MM-DD` |

### Interactive terminal chat

In `dailybot ask` (the AI chat), the native slash commands `/checkins`,
`/checkin edit`, and `/checkin reset` drive these same flows with numbered
prompts — handy for humans; agents should use the headless commands above.

---

## Step 3.7 — Authoring check-ins (create / configure / questions)

> **Requires `dailybot-cli >= 3.8.0`** (the skill-pack baseline). The authoring surface — `checkin create`,
> `checkin config`, `checkin archive`, the `checkin questions add|edit|delete|reorder`
> group, resolving people by email, the smart/AI flags, and the **create requires
> ≥ 1 question** rule (`questions_required`) — is all available. If
> `dailybot --version` is below 3.8.0, run `dailybot upgrade`.

Everything above **answers** a check-in. This section **builds** one. As of the
authoring release, an agent can create a check-in from scratch, tune every
scheduling / reminder / privacy / AI setting, manage its questions (including
conditional jump logic), verify the result with a round-trip read, and archive
it — all headless with an API key.

> **Role-gated.** Configuring, archiving a check-in, and editing its questions
> are **admin/manager** operations server-side. **Creating** a check-in is now
> allowed for **any authenticated member**.
> Update and delete remain admin/manager only. Answering check-ins (Steps 2–3.5)
> is not role-gated.

### Create in one shot vs. configure incrementally

There are two authoring styles, and they share the same flag vocabulary:

- **One-shot create** — `dailybot checkin create -n "Name" [all the flags]`
  builds a fully-configured check-in in a single call, seeding questions with
  `--questions-file` / `--interactive` / `--ai-short-question`.
- **Incremental configure** — `dailybot checkin create -n "Name" --user @me
  --questions-file q.json` first (participant + at least one question are both
  mandatory), then `dailybot checkin config <followup_uuid> [flags]` to change
  settings later. **`config` is a partial update: only the flags you pass
  change**; everything else is left untouched. This is the safest way for an
  agent to adjust one setting without disturbing the rest.

Both accept the same scheduling / reminder / submission / privacy / smart-AI /
participant / channel flags below. A few flags are **create-only** or
**config-only** — the reference table calls those out.

```bash
# Create a check-in (minimal — one participant AND one question are mandatory)
dailybot checkin create -n "Daily Standup" --user me@example.com --questions-file q.json

# Later, flip one setting without touching anything else
dailybot checkin config <followup_uuid> --time 09:30 --reminders 2
```

> **Timeout**: Allow at least 30 seconds for these commands. Do not use a shorter timeout.

### Participants are required (read this first)

**A check-in must have at least one participant AND at least one question.**

- **Non-interactive create with no `--user` and no `--team` fails fast** with
  `checkin_requires_participant`. Always pass at least one participant when
  scripting a create.
- **Create with no questions fails fast** with `questions_required` — seed at
  least one question with `--questions-file` or `--interactive` (add/edit/remove
  more later via `checkin questions`).
- In an interactive TTY, `create` **prompts** for participants instead of
  erroring.
- On **`config`, `--user` / `--team` REPLACE the entire participant set** (full
  replace, not append). To add one person you must re-list everyone who should
  remain. Same semantics for `--report-channel` (see channels below).

```bash
# Two people + a whole team as participants
dailybot checkin create -n "Daily Standup" \
  --user me@example.com --user "Jane Doe" \
  --team "My Team"
```

### Full flag reference (`create` / `config`)

Users resolve by **name, email, or UUID**. Resolving a `--user` by **email
needs admin/manager permissions**; when that lookup isn't allowed the CLI falls
back with a clear message (use a UUID or name instead).

#### Scheduling

| Flag | Values / format | Notes |
|------|-----------------|-------|
| `--time` | `HH:MM` | Delivery time. |
| `--days` | comma weekdays `0-6` | `0 = Sunday`. E.g. `1,2,3,4,5` = Mon–Fri. |
| `--timezone` | IANA name | E.g. `America/New_York`. |
| `--schedule-file` | JSON path | Full schedule object from a file. |
| `--start-on` / `--end-on` | `YYYY-MM-DD` | Active window bounds. |
| `--frequency` | `weekly` **only** | Weekly cadence. Monthly/custom go through `--frequency-advanced` — `--frequency monthly` fails fast (`invalid_frequency_type`). |
| `--every` | integer `>= 1` | Repeat interval (every N periods). |
| `--frequency-advanced` | `disabled` / `monthly` / `custom` | Advanced cadence selector. Use `custom` with `--cron`. |
| `--cron` | `"m h dom mon dow"` | 5-field cron, **for `custom` cadence only**. |
| `--trigger-based` / `--fixed-time` | flag | Trigger-based vs. fixed-time delivery. |
| `--participant-timezone` / `--custom-timezone` | flag | Use each participant's TZ vs. one custom TZ. |
| `--report-time` | `HH:MM` | When the aggregated report is posted. |

#### Reminders

| Flag | Values | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `--reminders` | `0-5` | Number of reminders. `0` = off. |
| `--reminder-interval` | `0-60` | Minutes between reminders. |
| `--reminder-condition` | `smart_frequency` / `fixed_frequency` | When reminders fire. |
| `--reminder-tone` | `standard` / `persuasive` | Reminder voice (`invalid_reminder_tone` if other). |

#### Submission rules

| Flag | Notes |
|------|-------|
| `--work-days` / `--no-work-days` | Restrict to working days. |
| `--allow-early` / `--no-early` | Allow submitting before the trigger time. |
| `--allow-past` / `--no-past` | Allow backfilling past responses. |
| `--allow-future` / `--no-future` | Allow future-dating responses. |
| `--one-by-one` / `--aggregated` | Deliver questions one-by-one vs. all at once. |

#### Privacy / anonymity

| Flag | Values | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `--anonymous` / `--no-anonymous` | flag | **Irreversible**: once anonymous, `--no-anonymous` fails with `anonymous_irreversible` (unlike forms). |
| `--privacy` | `only_owner`, `owner_and_members`, `managers_and_members`, `managers_and_admins`, `org_admins`, `everyone`, `custom` | Who can see responses. |

#### Smart / AI

| Flag | Values | Dependency |
|------|--------|-----------|
| `--smart` / `--no-smart` | flag | Adaptive AI conversation mode. |
| `--intelligence` / `--no-intelligence` | flag | AI insights on responses. **Requires `--smart`.** |
| `--max-clarifying` | `0-5` | Cap on AI follow-up questions. **Requires `--intelligence`** when `> 0`. |

The dependency chain is enforced server-side: `--intelligence` without `--smart`
and `--max-clarifying > 0` without `--intelligence` both fail with
`intelligence_requires_smart_checkin`.

#### Intro / outro

| Flag | Notes |
|------|-------|
| `--intro` | Opening message, `3–1024` chars. |
| `--outro` | Closing message, `3–1024` chars. |

#### Participants

| Flag | Scope | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| `--user` | create + config | Name, email, or UUID. Repeatable. On `config`, REPLACES the user set. |
| `--team` | create + config | Name or UUID. Repeatable. On `config`, REPLACES the team set. |

#### Channels

| Flag | Notes |
|------|-------|
| `--report-channel` | Channel UUID. Repeatable, **max 3** (`too_many_report_channels`, enforced client- and server-side). On `config`, REPLACES the channel set. |

#### Questions seeding (create) + config-only flags

| Flag | Scope | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| `--questions-file` | create | Seed questions from a JSON array (see below). |
| `--interactive` | create | Prompt for questions interactively. |
| `--ai-short-question` | create | Let AI generate report titles for seeded questions. |
| `-n` / `--name` | create + config | Check-in name. |
| `--active` / `--inactive` | config | Activate / deactivate the check-in. |

### Question authoring (`checkin questions ...`)

Questions are managed with a dedicated subgroup. **This is the same question
model forms use** — the types, report-title rule, variations, and conditional
logic below are shared.

```bash
dailybot checkin questions add    <followup_uuid> --type TYPE --question TEXT [flags]
dailybot checkin questions edit   <followup_uuid> <question_uuid> [same flags]
dailybot checkin questions delete <followup_uuid> <question_uuid>
dailybot checkin questions reorder <followup_uuid> <q_uuid> <q_uuid> ...
```

#### Question types

The complete catalog is **four** types — there are no others:

| `--type` | Options? | Behavior |
|----------|----------|----------|
| `text` | no | Free-text answer. |
| `multiple_choice` | **yes** — `--options "A,B,C"` | Choose from a fixed list. |
| `boolean` | no | Yes/No answer. |
| `numeric` | no | Numeric answer. |

Common flags on `add` / `edit`:

| Flag | Notes |
|------|-------|
| `--required` / `--optional` | Whether an answer is mandatory. |
| `--blocker` / `--no-blocker` | Tag the "blocker" question. |
| `--short-question` | Report title, `<= 512` chars. See the rule below. |
| `--ai-short-question` | Let AI generate the report title instead. |
| `--variation` | Alternate phrasing. Repeatable, **up to 10**, rotated per run. |
| `--logic-file` | Conditional logic from a JSON file. |
| `--jump-if-equals` / `--jump-to` / `--else-jump-to` | Inline conditional logic (see below). |

#### Report title is REQUIRED on `add`

Every added question needs a **report title** (the short label used in the
posted report). Provide it **one of two ways**:

- `--short-question "Title"` — an explicit title (`<= 512` chars), **or**
- `--ai-short-question` — let Dailybot's AI generate one.

Explicit titles are preserved; **AI only fills in the blanks**. Passing neither
is an error: `short_question_required`. On **`edit`** the report title is **not**
required (edits are partial updates).

```bash
# Add a required text question with an explicit report title + two variations
dailybot checkin questions add <followup_uuid> \
  --type text --question "What did you complete yesterday?" \
  --short-question "Yesterday" --required \
  --variation "What did you get done since your last update?" \
  --variation "Recap of yesterday's work?"

# Add a multiple-choice question and let AI name it
dailybot checkin questions add <followup_uuid> \
  --type multiple_choice --question "How's the sprint going?" \
  --options "On track,At risk,Blocked" --ai-short-question
```

#### Reordering

`questions reorder` takes the **complete set** of question UUIDs in the new
order. Passing a partial/incomplete set is rejected with
`question_uuids_incomplete` — always list **every** question.

```bash
dailybot checkin questions reorder <followup_uuid> \
  <q_uuid_c> <q_uuid_a> <q_uuid_b>
```

#### Conditional logic (jump rules)

A question can branch to a later question (or end the check-in) based on the
answer. Attach logic **either** with a full JSON file (`--logic-file`) **or**
inline with `--jump-if-equals VALUE --jump-to N [--else-jump-to M]`.

**Logic shape:**

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "rules_if": [
      {
        "conditions": [
          {"operator": "is_equal_to", "comparison_value": "Blocked", "logic_connector": "or"}
        ],
        "then": {"action": "jump_to", "target": 5}
      }
    ],
    "rules_else": {"action": "jump_to", "target": -1}
  }
}
```

- **`rules_else` is required.**
- **Jump targets are forward-only**: `target` must be **greater than this
  question's index**, or `-1` (end the check-in). The **server owns the index**
  and **auto-clamps dangling targets** when a question is deleted or reordered.

**Operators by question type:**

| Type | Operators |
|------|-----------|
| `text` | `is_equal_to`, `is_not_equal_to`, `contains`, `not_contains`, `begins_with`, `not_begins_with`, `ends_with`, `not_ends_with` |
| `numeric` | `is_equal_to`, `is_not_equal_to`, `lower_than`, `lower_or_equal_than`, `greater_than`, `greater_or_equal_than` |
| `multiple_choice` / `boolean` | `is_equal_to`, `is_not_equal_to` |

**Logic connectors:**

| Type | Allowed connectors |
|------|--------------------|
| `text` / `numeric` / `boolean` | `and`, `or` |
| `multiple_choice` | `or` only |

Boolean comparison values are JSON `true` / `false` (the CLI coerces
`--jump-if-equals true` / `--jump-if-equals false`).

**Actions:**

| `action` | `target` |
|----------|----------|
| `jump_to` | integer question index (forward-only, or `-1` = end) |
| `trigger_checkin` | a check-in UUID |
| `trigger_form` | a form UUID |

**Inline jump example** — if the blocker answer is `Yes`, skip ahead to question 4:

```bash
dailybot checkin questions add <followup_uuid> \
  --type boolean --question "Any blockers?" \
  --short-question "Blockers" --blocker \
  --jump-if-equals true --jump-to 4 --else-jump-to -1
```

### `--questions-file` JSON format

`--questions-file` (and forms' equivalent) is a **JSON array**, **max 50
questions**. Each object supports:

| Key | Alias | Notes |
|-----|-------|-------|
| `question_type` | `type` | One of the four types. |
| `question` | `label` | The question text. |
| `options` | | For `multiple_choice`. |
| `required` | | Boolean. |
| `is_blocker` | | Boolean. |
| `short_question` | | Report title. |
| `variations` | | Array of alternate phrasings. |
| `logic` | | Logic object (same shape as above). |

```json
[
  {
    "question_type": "text",
    "question": "What did you complete yesterday?",
    "short_question": "Yesterday",
    "required": true,
    "variations": ["Recap of yesterday's work?"]
  },
  {
    "question_type": "text",
    "question": "What are you working on today?",
    "short_question": "Today",
    "required": true
  },
  {
    "question_type": "boolean",
    "question": "Any blockers?",
    "short_question": "Blockers",
    "is_blocker": true,
    "logic": {
      "rules": {
        "rules_if": [
          {"conditions": [{"operator": "is_equal_to", "comparison_value": true, "logic_connector": "or"}],
           "then": {"action": "jump_to", "target": 3}}
        ],
        "rules_else": {"action": "jump_to", "target": -1}
      }
    }
  }
]
```

### Round-trip verification (`checkin show`)

After authoring, read the full config back with `dailybot checkin show
<followup_uuid> --json` and confirm it matches your intent. The detail JSON:

```json
{
  "id": "<uuid>",
  "name": "Daily Standup",
  "is_active": true,
  "is_archived": false,
  "schedule": {"days": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], "time": "09:00", "timezone": "America/New_York"},
  "start_on": "2026-07-01",
  "end_on": null,

### Archiving

`dailybot checkin archive <followup_uuid> [--yes]` soft-deletes a check-in
(confirms first unless `--yes`).

### Authoring error codes

| `code` | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `questions_required` | Create had no questions — seed ≥ 1 with `--questions-file`/`--interactive`. |
| `checkin_requires_participant` | Create had no `--user`/`--team` — add at least one participant. |
| `intelligence_requires_smart_checkin` | `--intelligence` needs `--smart`; `--max-clarifying > 0` needs `--intelligence`. |
| `anonymous_irreversible` | Tried `--no-anonymous` on an already-anonymous check-in — not allowed. |
| `too_many_report_channels` | More than 3 `--report-channel` values. |
| `short_question_required` | `add` had neither `--short-question` nor `--ai-short-question`. |
| `invalid_frequency_type` | Used `--frequency` for a non-weekly cadence — use `--frequency-advanced`. |
| `invalid_reminder_tone` | `--reminder-tone` was not `standard`/`persuasive`. |
| `invalid_frequency_cron` | Malformed 5-field `--cron` expression. |
| `question_uuids_incomplete` | `reorder` didn't list every question UUID. |
| `unknown_field` | CLI sent a field the server doesn't recognize → suggests `dailybot upgrade`. |

### End-to-end examples

**1. Daily standup with participants + reminders, seeded from a questions file:**

```bash
# 1. Create with schedule, participants, a report channel, and reminders
dailybot checkin create -n "Daily Standup" \
  --time 09:00 --days 1,2,3,4,5 --timezone America/New_York \
  --frequency weekly --every 1 \
  --reminders 2 --reminder-interval 15 --reminder-condition smart_frequency \
  --user me@example.com --team "My Team" \
  --report-channel <channel-uuid> \
  --intro "Good morning! Time for standup." \
  --questions-file ./standup-questions.json

# 2. Verify the round-trip
dailybot checkin show <followup_uuid> --json
```

**2. Smart AI check-in with insights and capped follow-ups:**

```bash
dailybot checkin create -n "Weekly Retro" \
  --time 16:00 --days 5 --timezone America/New_York \
  --smart --intelligence --max-clarifying 3 \
  --privacy managers_and_members \
  --user me@example.com

dailybot checkin questions add <followup_uuid> \
  --type text --question "What went well this week?" \
  --short-question "Wins" --required
```

**3. Custom-cron cadence (first business day of the month) + conditional logic:**

```bash
# Custom cadence needs --frequency-advanced custom + a 5-field --cron
dailybot checkin create -n "Monthly Ops Review" \
  --frequency-advanced custom --cron "0 9 1 * *" \
  --timezone America/New_York \
  --team "My Team"

# A blocker question that jumps to a detail question when there ARE blockers
dailybot checkin questions add <followup_uuid> \
  --type boolean --question "Any blockers?" \
  --short-question "Blockers" --blocker \
  --jump-if-equals true --jump-to 2 --else-jump-to -1

# Incrementally flip one setting later (partial update — nothing else changes)
dailybot checkin config <followup_uuid> --reminders 1 --reminder-tone persuasive
```

---

## Step 4 — HTTP Fallback (when CLI is unavailable)

See [`../shared/http-fallback.md`](../shared/http-fallback.md) for base patterns.

**Important:** Check-in endpoints accept **either** Bearer token or `X-API-KEY` auth.

### List pending check-ins

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DAILYBOT_BEARER_TOKEN" \
  https://api.dailybot.com/v1/cli/status/
```

### List responses (history)

```bash
# Default — ALL participants' responses in the date range (no user scoping)
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DAILYBOT_BEARER_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.dailybot.com/v1/checkins/<followup_uuid>/responses/?date_start=2026-06-01&date_end=2026-06-30"

# Narrow to one participant (admin/manager callers only)
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DAILYBOT_BEARER_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.dailybot.com/v1/checkins/<followup_uuid>/responses/?date_start=2026-06-01&date_end=2026-06-30&user=<user_uuid>"
```

**Scoping contract for `GET /v1/checkins/<followup_uuid>/responses/`:**

| Scenario | Query params | Result |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| See all responses | *(none)* | Every participant's responses in the date range |
| Filter to one user (admin/manager) | `?user=<user_uuid>` | Only that user's responses |
| Filter to one user (member) | `?user=<user_uuid>` | Only the caller's own responses (server-side guard) |

- The default returns **all participants' responses** — no user filter is applied.
- `?all=true` is **not needed** for check-in responses (the default already returns
  everything). It is accepted as a harmless no-op if a legacy integration still sends it.

> **Check-ins vs. forms differ.** The check-in responses endpoint defaults to
> **all participants**; the form responses endpoint
> (`GET /v1/forms/<form_uuid>/responses/`) defaults to the **caller's own** responses
> and requires `?all=true` (admin/owner with `VIEW_REPORTS`) to widen the scope. This
> asymmetry is intentional and reflects each endpoint's historical design.

### Complete a check-in

```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DAILYBOT_BEARER_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  https://api.dailybot.com/v1/checkins/<followup_uuid>/responses/ \
  -d '{
    "responses": [
      {"uuid": "<question-uuid>", "index": 0, "response": "Shipped the auth refactor"},
      {"uuid": "<question-uuid>", "index": 1, "response": "Starting payment integration"},
      {"uuid": "<question-uuid>", "index": 2, "response": "None"}
    ],
    "last_question_index": 2
  }'
```

### Obtaining a Bearer token programmatically

```bash
# Step 1 — request OTP
curl -s -X POST https://api.dailybot.com/v1/cli/request-code/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"user@example.com"}'

# Step 2 — verify OTP (returns token)
curl -s -X POST https://api.dailybot.com/v1/cli/verify-code/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"user@example.com","code":"123456"}'
# → {"token":"<bearer-token>","organization":"Org Name"}
```

---

## Step 5 — Confirm

After the command runs:

- **Success** — briefly confirm. Example: *"Submitted your Daily Standup check-in to Dailybot."*
- **Failure** — warn briefly. If not authenticated (exit code 3), suggest `dailybot login`.
- **Skipped** — say nothing.

---

## Non-Blocking Rule

Check-in completion must **never block your primary work**. If the CLI is missing, auth fails, the network is down, or the command errors:

1. Warn the developer briefly
2. Continue with the primary task
3. Do not retry automatically
4. Do not enter a diagnostic loop
