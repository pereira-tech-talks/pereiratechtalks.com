# Dailybot Report Channels

> **Requires `dailybot-cli >= 3.8.0`** (the skill-pack baseline). The `dailybot channels list`
> command is available at this floor. If `dailybot --version` reports below
> 3.8.0, ask the developer to run `dailybot upgrade`. See
> [`../SKILL.md` § Required Dailybot CLI version](../SKILL.md#required-dailybot-cli-version).

Report channels are the Slack / Microsoft Teams / Discord / Google Chat
destinations where Dailybot posts form and check-in reports. This sub-skill lists
the channels available to you so their UUIDs can be attached to a form or check-in
with `--report-channel` during authoring.

## Auth model — API key or login

Works under a login session (Bearer) **or** an org API key (`DAILYBOT_API_KEY`).
Visibility is role-scoped server-side; the CLI never client-filters.

## When to Use

- The developer is **authoring** a form or check-in (see
  [`../forms/SKILL.md`](../forms/SKILL.md) § Authoring and
  [`../checkin/SKILL.md`](../checkin/SKILL.md) § Authoring) and needs a channel
  UUID for `--report-channel`.
- The developer asks "which channels can Dailybot post to?".

Do **not** use this to *send* a message to a channel — that's `dailybot-chat`.

## Step 1 — List channels

```bash
# Human-readable table
dailybot channels list

# Machine-readable (recommended for agents)
dailybot channels list --json
```

JSON shape:

```json
[
  {"uuid": "abc123-def456", "name": "#engineering", "platform": "slack", "channel_id": "C0123ABCDEF"}
]
```

## Step 2 — Use a channel UUID in authoring

```bash
dailybot form create -n "Sprint Retro" --report-channel abc123-def456
dailybot checkin config <followup_uuid> --report-channel abc123-def456
```

`--report-channel` is repeatable to attach multiple channels.

## Non-Blocking Rule

If the CLI is unavailable or unauthenticated, surface the issue once and continue;
never block work on channel discovery. The HTTP fallback is
`GET /v1/report-channels/` (see [`../shared/http-fallback.md`](../shared/http-fallback.md)).
