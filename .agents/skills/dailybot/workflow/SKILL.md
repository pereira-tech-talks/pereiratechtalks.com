# Dailybot Workflows (read-only)

> **Requires `dailybot-cli >= 3.7.0`** (the skill-pack baseline). The `dailybot workflow list` /
> `dailybot workflow get` command group is available. If
> `dailybot --version` reports below 3.7.0, ask the developer to run
> `dailybot upgrade`. See [`../SKILL.md` § Required Dailybot CLI version](../SKILL.md#required-dailybot-cli-version)
> for install commands and version-check tooling.

You help developers **read** the workflows configured for their organization.
Workflows are Dailybot's automation objects (multi-step sequences that connect
check-ins, forms, and chat actions). This skill is **read-only** — it lists
workflows and reads one workflow's configuration so an agent can reference or
explain them.

> **Writes are web-app only.** Creating, editing, enabling, or deleting a
> workflow is done in the Dailybot web app — there is **no** CLI write path.
> Do not attempt to mutate a workflow from the CLI; if the developer wants to
> change one, point them at the Dailybot web app.

> **Plan-gated feature.** Workflows are available on higher-tier plans. On a
> plan without them (and on the FREE plan generally) these reads return
> `403 plan_upgrade_required` with an `upgrade_url` — surface the upgrade path
> and stop. See [`../shared/list-query-and-errors.md`](../shared/list-query-and-errors.md) § 6.

## Auth model — API key or login

Workflow reads accept **either** a Bearer login session (`dailybot login`)
**or** an org API key (`DAILYBOT_API_KEY`). Results are scoped to the acting
identity's permissions (the server resolves the API key's owner). See
[`../shared/list-query-and-errors.md`](../shared/list-query-and-errors.md) § 6
for the full API-key ↔ Bearer parity and plan-gating rules.

---

## When to Use

- "list my workflows", "show the org's workflows", "what workflows do we have?"
- "show me the release workflow", "what's configured in workflow X?"
- Another skill needs a workflow's UUID or its configuration for context.

Do **not** use this skill to *create* or *change* a workflow — that's a web-app
operation. And do not confuse it with **form workflow states** (the
`draft → review → released` states inside a single form) — those are managed in
[`../forms/SKILL.md`](../forms/SKILL.md). This skill is the org-level
**workflow** object.

---

## Step 1 — Verify Setup

Read and follow the authentication steps in [`../shared/auth.md`](../shared/auth.md).

Confirm at least one credential is present:

```bash
dailybot status --auth 2>&1
```

If auth fails or the developer declines, skip and continue with your primary task.

---

## Step 2 — List Workflows

```bash
dailybot workflow list --json
```

Returns the workflows visible to the caller in the standard pagination
envelope (`{count, next, previous, results}`), and prints a `Showing X of N`
footer in human mode.

### Query flags

`workflow list` accepts the **full shared list query flag set** — pagination
(`--page`, `--page-size`, `--all`, `--limit`), search (`--search` / `--grep`),
and date range (`--since`, `--until`, `--date`, `--last-week`, `--today`). The
complete flag table, defaults, and the envelope/footer contract live in
[`../shared/list-query-and-errors.md`](../shared/list-query-and-errors.md) —
read it once and don't duplicate the reasoning here.

```bash
# Everything (default — walks all pages):
dailybot workflow list --json

# Search by name, most recent first page only:
dailybot workflow list --search release --page-size 20 --json

# Fetch every page explicitly:
dailybot workflow list --all --json
```

---

## Step 3 — Inspect a Workflow

```bash
dailybot workflow get <workflow_uuid> --json
```

Returns the single workflow's full configuration. Treat the JSON as the source
of truth for "what does this workflow do?"; surface the relevant parts to the
developer rather than re-deriving them.

---

## Step 4 — Error Handling

Match on the structured `code` field, never the prose `detail`. The full
error-code table (including `plan_upgrade_required`, `insufficient_role`, and
the 429 back-off behavior) is in
[`../shared/list-query-and-errors.md`](../shared/list-query-and-errors.md) § 5.

Most likely codes for this skill:

- `plan_upgrade_required` (403, carries `upgrade_url`) — workflows aren't on the
  org's plan. Surface the upgrade link and stop.
- `insufficient_role` / `org_admin_required` (403) — the caller's role can't
  read workflows. Suggest an admin runs it.
- Not authenticated (401) — guide through `dailybot login`.

---

## Step 5 — HTTP Fallback (when CLI is unavailable)

See [`../shared/http-fallback.md`](../shared/http-fallback.md) for base
patterns. Workflow endpoints accept **either** Bearer token or `X-API-KEY`.

### List workflows

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DAILYBOT_BEARER_TOKEN" \
  https://api.dailybot.com/v1/workflows/
```

### Get a single workflow

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $DAILYBOT_BEARER_TOKEN" \
  https://api.dailybot.com/v1/workflows/<workflow_uuid>/
```

---

## Step 6 — Confirm

- **Success** — surface the requested workflow(s) directly. If the count footer
  showed `X < N`, tell the developer the view is truncated and how to widen it.
- **Failure** — warn briefly. For `plan_upgrade_required`, name the plan gap and
  surface the `upgrade_url`.
- **Skipped** — say nothing.

---

## Non-Blocking Rule

Workflow reads must **never block your primary work**. If the CLI is missing,
auth fails, the feature isn't on the plan, the network is down, or any command
errors:

1. Warn the developer briefly.
2. Continue with the primary task.
3. Do not retry automatically.
4. Do not enter a diagnostic loop.
