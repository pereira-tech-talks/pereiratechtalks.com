# DeepWorkPlan — Execute

Execute a Deep Work Plan by working through its tasks **sequentially, one at a
time**, validating and committing after each, and reporting progress.

## Shared resources (read these)

- [`../shared/context.sh`](../shared/context.sh) — resolve repo root, branch,
  agent tool, and `dwp_dir` (the `.dwp/` output location).
- [`../shared/dwp-paths.md`](../shared/dwp-paths.md) — plans live at
  `.dwp/plans/PLAN_{name}/`.
- [`../shared/adaptation.md`](../shared/adaptation.md) — the two repository
  archetypes (individual repo vs orchestrator hub) that govern how navigation
  and validation commands resolve.
- [`../guide/GUIDE.md`](../guide/GUIDE.md) — execution rules (§6), orchestrator
  protocol (§13), team agents (§14).
- [`../spec/PLAN_STATE.md`](../spec/PLAN_STATE.md) — the machine-readable state
  layer (`manifest.json` + `state.json`); update it at every completion when the
  plan carries it.

## Parameter Support

- `/dwp-execute {plan_name}` — execute directly (skip the selection menu).
- `/dwp-execute latest` — execute the most recently modified plan.
- No parameter → interactive selection (Step 1).

Normalize names by adding the `PLAN_` prefix if missing. Validate that
`.dwp/plans/PLAN_{name}/` and its `README.md` exist; if not, show available plans
and ask the user to choose.

## Workflow

### Step 0 — Check for Parameters
If a parameter was given, resolve the plan (or "latest"), validate the folder and
README under `.dwp/plans/`, and skip to Step 2. Otherwise continue to Step 1.

### Step 1 — Identify Plan
List folders in `.dwp/plans/` starting with `PLAN_`; mark the most recently
modified as `latest`. Present a numbered menu and accept a number, plan name, or
`latest`. Validate the chosen plan's folder + README.

### Step 2 — Read Plan Overview
Read the plan README: goal, context, global guidelines, task list (`[x]` vs
`[ ]`), execution rules.

**Step 2.1 — Detect plan type.** Set `plan_type = "orchestrator"` if the README
has a "Child DWP Plans" section, or task files contain `create_child_dwp` /
`execute_child_dwp`. Note the execution mode (Distributed / Sequential / Sequential
with Output Handoff) and whether `ORCHESTRATOR_MANIFEST.md` exists in the plan
folder. Report orchestrator plans with their execution mode, manifest
availability, and child-DWP list.

**Step 2.2 — Detect team-agents configuration.** If the README has a "Team Agents
Configuration" section: team-agents mode is available. Verify
`CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`; if not set, inform the user and fall
back to sequential. If available and enabled, offer to use team agents for
parallel groups. Store the decision for Step 5.

### Step 3 — Check Current Status
Read the README task list; run `git status` and `git log --oneline -10`; identify
the first `[ ]` task. Report completed/pending tasks, the starting task, git
state, and recent commits. The location is `.dwp/plans/PLAN_{name}/`.

### Step 4 — Ask for Execution Preferences (optional)
Ask for any specific requirements (press Enter for defaults from the plan README).

### Step 5 — Execute Plan

Rules (strict):
1. **One task at a time** — always the first unchecked `[ ]` task. Never skip or
   reorder.
2. **For each task** — open `N.task_{title}.md`, read it fully, follow its
   instructions and Execution Checklist.

   **Addon augmentation of mandatory final tasks.** If the current task is a
   mandatory final task (`{N-2}.task_security_review.md`, etc.) AND an
   opt-in addon that augments it is installed in this repo, execute BOTH the
   base instruction body AND the addon augmentation. Currently the only such
   augmentation is [`../addons/ai-diff-reviewer/`](../addons/ai-diff-reviewer/SKILL.md)
   augmenting Security Review (detection — same predicate as
   `../create/SKILL.md` and addon SPEC §6.1: `.agents/skills/ai-diff-reviewer/`
   present **AND** an extension file at one of the three recognized paths, in
   precedence order: `.review/extension.md` >
   `.github/ai-diff-reviewer/extension.md` >
   `.github/ai-pr-reviewer/extension.md`; skill-only without an extension is
   NOT enough — do not run the local review pass mid–Security Review and do
   not surprise-bootstrap — extension creation belongs in addon onboarding
   / `generate-extension`, not mid–Security Review; if the skill is present
   but no extension exists, warn once that Flow A/B install is incomplete
   and continue the base Security Review). Augmentation details live in `../create/SKILL.md`
   "Three mandatory final tasks" and `../guide/GUIDE.md` §5.4 "AI Diff
   Reviewer local pass". The augmentation is best-effort on *invocation*
   only — if the skill/extension is missing or the local review errors,
   warn once and continue; once a review runs, `critical` findings follow
   the existing SR contract (block until fixed or explicitly accepted).
3. **Run validations** — execute ALL validation commands. If any fail: STOP, log
   the issue in the task's Completion & Log, do NOT mark `[x]`, report and wait
   for guidance. **Test discipline (`../guide/GUIDE.md` §5.3):** if the task added
   new core functionality or changed product behavior, confirm it added/updated
   automated tests for that behavior and that validation runs the repo's tests +
   lint/type-check (not just the build). If a behavior change shipped with no test
   coverage where the repo supports tests, treat it as an incomplete gate — add the
   missing tests before marking `[x]`, or log it as a blocker.
   **Security discipline (`../guide/GUIDE.md` §5.4):** if the task touched auth,
   input handling, secrets/config, network surface, or dependencies, confirm its
   security acceptance criteria are met and the diff contains no secret material
   before committing.
4. **Mark complete** — only when all acceptance criteria are met and all
   validations pass. Update the README `[ ] → [x]` and fill the task's Completion
   & Log (status, timestamp, summary, files changed, validation results, notes).
5. **Commit** after each completed task using conventional commits:
   `type(scope): complete task N - description`.
   Where the plan carries the state layer (`../spec/PLAN_STATE.md`), rewrite
   `state.json` atomically as the final completion step: task `completed`,
   gate records (`command`, `passes`, `evidence`), a short outcome record
   (tried / failed / worked), and the commit hash.
6. **Dailybot per-task report (only for individually significant tasks)** — after
   committing a task that is independently significant (feature, bug fix, major
   refactor), trigger the `dailybot` skill (e.g. "report this to Dailybot" or
   `/dailybot_report`) with a standup-style message — WHAT was accomplished + WHY
   it matters. Do NOT report intermediate setup tasks; the plan-completion report
   (Step 7) covers those. Never use internal "Completed Task N" phrasing. If
   reporting fails, continue without blocking. The `dailybot` skill is installed
   alongside this skill in the agent's skills directory — invoke it there.
7. **Move to the next `[ ]` task** and repeat.

**Stop conditions:** all tasks `[x]`; a validation fails; the user requests a
pause; a blocking issue.

#### Autonomous mode (long-horizon, hours-long runs)

A Deep Work Plan is designed to be executed **autonomously for hours**, across
many tasks and even across a context-window reset. The normative contract for
this mode is the **unattended execution profile**
(`../spec/AGENT_PROTOCOL.md` §7): the plan must be pre-approved, the state layer
(`../spec/PLAN_STATE.md`) is REQUIRED, authority is bounded by the plan, and the
stop conditions of §7.3 apply. When the developer asks to run unattended (or
passes `trust` / `auto`):

- **Continue without per-task confirmation.** Run task → validate → commit →
  update `PROGRESS.md` → next task, in a loop. Do not stop to ask "shall I
  continue?" between tasks.
- **Stop only on a real boundary:** a failed validation gate, genuine ambiguity,
  a blocking dependency, an unsafe/destructive action outside the plan's scope, or
  plan completion. On a stop, log the reason in the task's Completion & Log,
  populate `state.json.blocked` (task, reason, what it needs), and report.
  **When the Dailybot addon is wired**, also send a **regular** report with the
  `blockers` field derived from `state.json.blocked` — the team sees what is
  stuck and what it needs instead of discovering a silent halt
  (`../addons/dailybot/SPEC.md` §5.1). Best-effort, never blocks.
- **Checkpoint every task.** Progress lives on disk — the README checkboxes, each
  task's Completion & Log, and `PROGRESS.md` (summaries, key decisions, important
  values/paths). After each task this state MUST be current, because it is the
  only thing that survives a context-window reset.
- **Resume from disk, not memory.** If context is exhausted or a fresh agent takes
  over, do not rely on conversation history: re-read the plan README, `PROGRESS.md`,
  and the Completion & Logs, then continue at the first `[ ]` task (this is exactly
  what the `resume` sub-skill does). Re-anchor to the plan goal before each task to
  prevent drift over the long horizon.

#### Step 5.0.1 — Team-Agents Parallel Groups

> **CRITICAL: use REAL team agents, NOT subagents.** When the plan has a "Team
> Agents Configuration" section and team-agents mode was selected, you MUST use
> `TeamCreate` + `Agent` with `team_name` + `TaskCreate` + `SendMessage` +
> `TeamDelete`. Do NOT call `Agent` alone (no `team_name`) — that creates
> subagents, which only report back to the caller. Team agents share a task list
> and communicate with each other.

At a parallel-group boundary:
1. Announce the parallel group.
2. `TeamCreate` with `team_name: "dwp-{plan_name}-group-{letter}"`.
3. Spawn teammates with `Agent` + `team_name` + `subagent_type:
   "general-purpose"`, passing each its task file content + the plan README's
   Goal/Context/Guidelines + commit instructions.
4. `TaskCreate` one shared task per parallel task; assign each to its teammate via
   `TaskUpdate` (`owner`).
5. Monitor: receive teammate messages, `SendMessage` as needed; when all parallel
   tasks complete, verify each is `[x]` in the README. If a teammate fails, log
   and recover or fall back to sequential.
6. Clean up: `SendMessage` a `shutdown_request` to each teammate, wait for
   confirmation, then `TeamDelete`. Continue with the next sequential task/group.
7. Each teammate commits its own task; the lead verifies commits afterward.

**Verify real team agents:** the status bar shows `Team: dwp-...-group-X · N
teammates`, NOT `N local agents`.

**Sequential fallback:** if team-agents execution fails at any point, log the
reason and execute the remaining group tasks sequentially (standard single-task
rules) — no special handling needed.

#### Step 5.1 — Orchestrator Task Types

Orchestrator navigation generalizes across the two archetypes (see
`../shared/adaptation.md`):
- **Orchestrator-hub archetype** — the hub coordinates sub-repos under
  `repositories/{repo}/`. Navigate with `cd repositories/{repo_name}` to operate
  in a child repo, and return to the hub root (resolve it via
  `../shared/context.sh` — e.g. the git toplevel) between tasks. Child plans live
  at `repositories/{repo}/.dwp/plans/PLAN_{child}/`.
- **Individual-repo archetype** — the repo resolves its own root via
  `../shared/context.sh`; there is no `repositories/` layer. Child-DWP task types
  rarely apply here.

**`create_child_dwp` tasks:** navigate to the target repo; read its `AGENTS.md`
(validation commands, test patterns, commit format, stack); install/confirm
DeepWorkPlan there if missing (it ships its own guide/examples); create the child
DWP at `{child_repo_root}/.dwp/plans/PLAN_{feature}_{repo_short}/` using that
repo's conventions and validation commands (NOT the hub's), including a parent
plan reference; return to the hub root and mark the child `[x] Created` in the
orchestrator README's Child DWP Plans table. In **Sequential** mode also execute
the child DWP immediately (committing in that repo) and mark `[x] Created /
[x] Executed`; in **Distributed** mode create only.

**`integration_checkpoint` tasks:** read the checkpoint criteria and all created
child DWPs; verify integration points (API contracts, data model field
names/types, naming, error handling) across repos; report each pass/fail; fix
blockers or flag for the user.

**`execute_child_dwp` tasks:** verify execution readiness from
`ORCHESTRATOR_MANIFEST.md` (all predecessors `[x] Executed`, outputs listed) — if
any predecessor is missing, STOP and report BLOCKED. Load predecessor executive
reports as context; navigate to the target repo; execute the child DWP using that
repo's validation commands; commit there; return to the hub and register outputs
in the manifest (mark `[x] Executed`, add a Completed Output Reference) and update
the README to `[x] Created / [x] Executed`.

### Step 6 — Progress Reporting
After each task: `✓ Task N completed: {title}` with files changed, validation
result, commit, and the next task. On failure: `✗ Task N validation failed` with
the error, blocked status, and `[ ]` retained.

### Step 7 — Completion

When all tasks are `[x]`, report the completion summary (all tasks, totals,
commits, final commit).

**Security gate:** a plan is complete only when the Security Review task's
`analysis_results/SECURITY_REVIEW.md` exists and reports no unresolved critical
finding (`../spec/DWP_SPECIFICATION.md` §6.1). If a critical finding is open,
the plan is **blocked**, not complete — fix it or obtain the user's explicit
acceptance before reporting completion.

**🔔 GOLDEN RULE — Dailybot Plan-Completion Report (MANDATORY):**

> When a DWP plan finishes execution, you MUST ALWAYS send a Dailybot progress
> report **as a milestone**. A completed plan is always a significant milestone.

Trigger the `dailybot` skill (e.g. `/dailybot_report` or "report this milestone
to Dailybot") in Daily Standup style describing WHAT the plan accomplished and
its impact. Mark it as a **milestone** with structured data
(completed/in-progress/blockers). NEVER use internal references (plan names, task
counts, DWP terminology).
- GOOD: *"Finished the authentication refactor — the API now uses JWT tokens
  across all services with centralized middleware validation."*
- BAD: *"Plan completed: PLAN_auth_refactor - All 8 tasks completed."*

Craft it: read the plan README's Goal; summarize WHAT was accomplished in terms
the team cares about; add WHY it matters; 1–3 sentences; always English; always a
milestone. Where the plan carries the state layer (`../spec/PLAN_STATE.md`),
derive the report's `--json-data` from `state.json` — `completed` from completed
tasks phrased as outcomes, `blockers` empty on a clean finish — rather than
recounting from memory. The `dailybot` skill is installed alongside this skill —
invoke it there. If reporting fails, continue without blocking.

### Step 7.1 — Orchestrator Plan Completion
Report per mode (Distributed: all child DWPs created and ready, with the
dependency order and per-repo execute commands; Sequential / Sequential with
Output Handoff: all created and executed, with outputs and the fully-updated
manifest path). The same Dailybot milestone golden rule applies — describe what
the feature achieved across repos, never "N child DWPs executed."

## Important Notes
- Strict order; one task at a time; validation required; commit after each; stop
  on failure; the plan README is the source of truth.
- **Skill invocation:** when a task references a skill (`/{skill}`), invoke it
  directly. When it references agent-based validation, delegate to that agent.
- **Orchestrator navigation:** always return to the hub root between tasks (hub
  archetype). Orchestrator tracking updates are committed in the hub; child plan
  files live in each sub-repo's gitignored `.dwp/`.
- **Manifest:** read it at the start of orchestrator execution; update it after
  each `execute_child_dwp`. Verify predecessors before any `execute_child_dwp`.
- **Team agents:** detect, offer, fall back to sequential on failure, and always
  clean up the team after each parallel group. Mandatory final tasks (Security
  Review, Skills Discovery, Executive Report) are ALWAYS sequential under the lead.

## Error Handling
- Missing task file → report; ask whether to skip or create.
- Validation command fails → stop, log, report, wait.
- User requests pause → stop at the current task; `[x]` marks persist.
- Invalid plan structure → report; ask to fix or proceed with caution.
- Target repo not found / no `AGENTS.md` (orchestrator) → report; for missing
  `AGENTS.md`, create a minimal child DWP with generic validation and note it.
- Predecessor not executed (`execute_child_dwp`) → BLOCKED; list what's missing;
  do not proceed.
- Manifest missing but `execute_child_dwp` exists → warn; fall back to the
  README's Child DWP Plans table and predecessor executive reports; log the
  limitation.
