# DeepWorkPlan — Resume

Safely continue an interrupted plan from where it stopped — no duplicated work,
strict order, continuing from the first `[ ]` task — from **durable workspace
artifacts alone** (the plan folder on disk, gitignored `.dwp/` included): a
different session, agent, model or harness must be able to pick the plan up
without the previous conversation. A fresh clone without `.dwp/` has nothing
to resume — see *Persistence* below.

## Shared resources (read at their moment, not upfront)

The compulsory set for this flow is the router SKILL plus this file: every
rule the resumption assessment runs on is stated inline in Step 2 below. A
default resumption reads **no** guide, spec, shared companion, or execution
contract before assessment; each loads when its moment arrives. (This
ordering is deliberate: reading companions "to be safe" is the failure mode
this tiering removed.)

- **Essential now (before the first task):**
  [`../shared/context.sh`](../shared/context.sh) — **run** it
  (`bash ../shared/context.sh`) to resolve repo root, branch, agent tool and
  `dwp_dir`; its source is not part of this flow's reads. That is the whole
  t0 set — the resume protocol (Step 2) and the handoff rules are inline
  below.
- **Conditional — read only when the trigger fires:**
  - [`../execute/SKILL.md`](../execute/SKILL.md) — read only when Step 5
    resumes into the execution loop: the contract every resumed task runs
    under (gate selection from the actual surface, repair/stop, task-local
    closure, the Final Review, the Dailybot golden rule; team-agents and
    orchestrator branches on demand). Assessment — Steps 1–4 — never needs
    it: the closure order and interruption-boundary rules are inline above,
    and once loaded, that file's own conditional tier governs its
    execution-time companions.
  - [`../spec/PLAN_STATE.md`](../spec/PLAN_STATE.md) §5–§6 — read only when
    the plan carries `state.json` and a desync, a takeover, or a standard
    question needs the normative rule; the everyday needs (markdown wins,
    regenerate from the README, the checkpoint shape) are inline in Step 2.
  - [`../guide/prompts.md`](../guide/prompts.md) §9 — read only when the
    interruption is unusual enough that the Step 2.5 boundary table does not
    classify it (resume rules and scenarios).
  - [`../shared/dwp-paths.md`](../shared/dwp-paths.md) — read only when a
    plan folder cannot be located or the `DWP_DIR` override is in play
    (Steps 0–1 already inline `.dwp/plans/PLAN_{name}/`).
  - [`../shared/troubleshooting.md`](../shared/troubleshooting.md) — read
    only when something is already wrong (discovery failure, stale
    installation, missing test command, unsupported host capability,
    inconsistent plan state).
  - [`../guide/GUIDE.md`](../guide/GUIDE.md) — the routing index; consult
    only when a need is not covered by a section named above.
- **Never by default:** no other guide, spec, preset or addon file is read
  for this flow — not defensively, not "to be safe". `../shared/adaptation.md`
  and `../guide/execution.md` in particular are not resume reads: adaptation
  moments belong to the tasks being resumed (execute's conditional tier
  names them) and execution.md's moments are owned by execute/SKILL.md's
  tier once Step 5 loads it. Name the moment, then read.

## Parameter Support

- `/dwp-resume {plan_name}` — resume directly (skip the menu).
- `/dwp-resume latest` — resume the most recently modified plan.
- `/dwp-resume {plan_name} trust` (or `auto`, or "run to the end") — resume
  unattended: no questions between tasks (`../execute/SKILL.md` *Autonomous mode*).
- No parameter → interactive selection (Step 1).

Normalize the `PLAN_` prefix; validate `.dwp/plans/PLAN_{name}/` and its
`README.md`. If not found, show available plans and ask the user to choose. A
folder without `README.md`, or whose README says `Plan Status: materializing`,
is a partial materialization (its `manifest.json` records the intended shape) —
point to `refine`; never execute it.

## Lite and promotion recovery

For v2 Lite plans, read the README's canonical task index, inline anchor record,
state locator and checkpoint before reading older history. A README checkbox wins
over state on desync. Do not treat missing task files as partial when the format
is Lite. Conversely, a `promotion` marker or `materialization: promoting` is a
hard recovery boundary: inspect its phase, preserve existing files and route to
`/dwp-refine promote` to complete the missing transaction step. Never execute
product work in a mixed representation.

An explicit execute/resume request can approve a ready plan's current scope
(Lite or Full). If a new requirement changes scope, criteria or gate, record
the checkpoint and use refine; do not promote or alter approvals implicitly.

## Trust boundary (write scope)

`allowed-tools` includes write-capable `Edit`, `Write`, and `Bash`.

**Writes:** identical scope to `execute` (task outputs, `.dwp/` working state,
per-task commits after gates pass) — resuming does not widen the boundary.

**It MUST NOT:** re-run or "fix up" a completed `[x]` task — under the **DWP
Resume Protocol** (`../spec/DWP_SPECIFICATION.md` §5.3) those are trusted as
recorded, and only three things reopen one: the developer asks, `refine` left a
`(re-validate: …)` marker, or the smoke test fails in a way that implicates it;
skip that post-interruption smoke test, which validates the **world** (the
cheapest standing check) before anything is built on it; repeat a commit, gate,
skill authoring, report or other external action the evidence shows already
happened; migrate a legacy plan (that is `refine migrate`, on explicit request
only); push without instruction; or write outside the repo checkout and
`.dwp/`.

## Workflow

### Step 0 — Check for Parameters
If a parameter was given, resolve the plan (or `latest`), validate folder +
README under `.dwp/plans/`, note `trust`/`auto`, and skip to Step 2. Otherwise
go to Step 1.

### Step 1 — Identify Plan
List `PLAN_*` folders in `.dwp/plans/`; mark the most recently modified as
`latest`. Present a numbered menu (number / name / `latest`) and validate the
choice.

### Step 2 — Assess Current State (CRITICAL)

This step implements the **DWP Resume Protocol**
(`../spec/DWP_SPECIFICATION.md` §5.3) — the named ritual any resuming session
performs. It reads the **compact index first** and retrieves history **by
pointer**, never by replaying everything.

1. **Load the compact working index.** Read the plan README's task list (the
   small `[x]`/`[ ]` index, the `Plan Status` count, the `**Standard:**` line and
   the pre-approval note), the **Active context** block of `PROGRESS.md` (goal
   and invariants, active task and next action, unresolved blockers, current
   contracts and decisions in force, direct pointers to durable records), and —
   when present — `state.json`'s `status`, `checkpoint`, `blocked`, and the
   entries of the **active task and its named dependencies only** (not every
   gate of every task). Do **not** read every task file or the whole history by
   default; retrieve older records later, by pointer, when a step needs them.
2. **Gather actual evidence.** Run `git status`, `git log --oneline -10`, and
   `git diff` (if uncommitted changes exist). In a workspace without git, read
   `state.json`'s `checkpoint` instead (`../spec/PLAN_STATE.md` §4.4). Note the
   current revision.
3. **Reconcile Markdown, JSON and the workspace — before any work.** The
   markdown wins every disagreement (`../spec/PLAN_STATE.md` §5):
   - Where `state.json` exists, gather machine evidence first: run
     `python3 ../verify/plan_contract.py <plan-dir>` (read-only) and surface
     every finding — failed gates, `invalidated by refine` reliance, evidence
     admitting non-execution, dangling `log=` pointers — in `PROGRESS.md`.
     Markdown wins a **status** disagreement; it never lets a summary override
     a failed gate, admitted non-execution, invalidated evidence or an
     implementation the tree does not show.
   - `state.json` vs README checkboxes disagree → regenerate `state.json` from the
     README (and git log), note the reconciliation in `PROGRESS.md`, continue.
   - `state.json.blocked` is set → surface it: that is why the plan stopped.
   - A `[x]` task with no matching commit where the plan commits, a checkpoint
     that names work the tree does not show, a summary that contradicts the
     files, or instructions in the working index that contradict the task file
     → **do not trust the summary or the flag alone**: inspect the files and the
     log, record the finding in `PROGRESS.md`, and treat the task as the
     evidence says (in doubt, as not completed). Never repeat a committed action.
   - A README `[ ]` marked `(re-validate: …)` → its implementation exists; only
     its gates are rerun (`../refine/SKILL.md` 3.7).
   - The plan declares a standard newer than this skill → report and stop.
4. **Find the resumption point** — the **first unchecked `[ ]` task** (a task
   `in_progress` in `state.json` with a checkpoint is the active one).
5. **Classify partial work at its interruption boundary.** Using the evidence
   from steps 2–3 and the active task's Completion & Log, decide **which single
   step is missing** and do only that (`../spec/PLAN_STATE.md` §5.1):

   | Interrupted… | Evidence to check | Then |
   |---|---|---|
   | at a clean task boundary (the commonest case) | the last task's whole closure order present and consistent, checkpoint pointing at un-started work | **no repair step is owed** — take over (2.6), smoke-test (2.7), start the next task. Do not hunt for a missing step |
   | before the gate ran | uncommitted changes; no gate record | finish the implementation if incomplete; run the gate **once** |
   | after the gate, before the commit | gate record present, `passes: true`, and the recorded `fp=` still matches the world — same revision (`git rev-parse HEAD`), same dirty/generated files (`git status --porcelain`), same environment; any difference invalidates reuse | rerun the gate, record the fresh result, then commit **once** |
   | after the commit, before the README/log update | commit exists in `git log`; README still `[ ]` | complete log → README → PROGRESS → `state.json`; do **not** re-commit |
   | between Markdown and `state.json` updates | README `[x]`, state stale | regenerate `state.json`; nothing else |
   | after an external action (report, push, PR, message) | the action's own evidence (report id, remote branch, PR URL in the log) | do **not** repeat it; record that it already happened — a missing receipt is investigated against the service's actual state, never guessed or re-sent |
   | mid-implementation with no checkpoint note | dirty tree only | review the diff against the task; incorporate valid partial progress, finish the rest |

   Changed inputs since a recorded gate (a later edit, a `refine`, a new
   revision) invalidate that gate → rerun it. Where the table resumes the
   tail of the update order, the `state.json` step may use the shipped
   updater (`../shared/update-state.py`) as a targeted, atomic mutation;
   only the reconcile-from-markdown row regenerates the whole file. Retain
   the original review baseline: when the interruption landed mid-review, the
   diff and criteria under review at the halt are the baseline resumed —
   rebuild nothing the checkpoint already records. An interrupted completion
   publication leaves a `.finalizing.json` marker in the plan folder: inspect
   it and recover via `python3 ../shared/finalize_plan.py <plan-dir>
   --candidate <candidate.json> --recover` before any other plan action.
6. **Takeover from another agent or model.** If the checkpoint, log or
   `PROGRESS.md` was written by a different agent/model (`state.json.updated_by`,
   the log's wording) or the session is a fresh context: read the checkpoint
   **pointer** (`task`, `step`, `note`) and verify it against the files it names;
   detect contradictory instructions, stale state (revision changed), dirty work
   and missing evidence **before** continuing; record a one-line "takeover"
   entry in `PROGRESS.md` (who/what, revision, what was verified). Only then
   continue. The handoff artifact is the plan itself — nothing required may live
   only in a prior conversation, a proprietary task API, or a hook.
7. **Smoke-test before building:** run the repo's cheapest standing check (from
   `AGENTS.md` Quick Commands) to confirm the world still works before adding to
   it. A failing smoke test is investigated first.

### Step 3 — Report Resumption Status
Report, compactly: the plan's standard and pre-approval; completed `[x]` /
pending `[ ]` counts; the task to resume from and its interruption boundary
(Step 2.5) with the single next action; git state (uncommitted changes, recent
commits, last commit); reconciliation or takeover findings; any blocker. Location:
`.dwp/plans/PLAN_{name}/`.

### Step 4 — Handle Partial Work
Apply the Step 2.5 decision. Interactive: if the partial work is unclear or
unrelated, ask the user before proceeding. **Unattended:** unclear or unrelated
changes are a `../spec/AGENT_PROTOCOL.md` §7.3 boundary (reality diverged) —
record `state.json.blocked` with what was found and halt; do not guess and do
not discard work.

### Step 5 — Resume Execution
1. **NEVER redo `[x]` tasks** — trust the README, cross-check git commits (and
   the `(re-validate…)` exception above).
2. **NEVER skip `[ ]` tasks** — strict order; complete each fully.
3. **Continue from the first `[ ]` task** — open its file, read fully, address any
   logged blocker first.
4. **Complete the current task** under the standard **Execute** rules
   (`../execute/SKILL.md` Step 5): gate selected from the actual surface; repair
   in scope or stop; task-local closure (skills decision → log → README →
   PROGRESS → commit → `state.json`).
5. **Keep the working context bounded while executing.** On a stable run retain
   the already-loaded, unchanged context; re-read after a revision change, a
   handoff, a context compaction, or uncertainty. Retrieve older records
   **only** when a task's `Read Before Starting` names them, a decision cannot
   be found in the active-context block, or a pointer is stale or missing — and
   then verify what was retrieved rather than guess. Never drop an unresolved
   constraint or an active contract to save space.
6. **Continue** to the next `[ ]` task until done or paused — without asking
   whether to continue inside the plan's authorization.

> From here, the standard **Execute** rules apply
> (`../execute/SKILL.md`): the per-task significance Dailybot report, the
> plan-completion **milestone** golden rule, the Final Review (a)–(e) with the
> one-time Executive Report offer, and — for orchestrator plans — orchestrator
> task types (`create_child_dwp` / `integration_checkpoint` /
> `execute_child_dwp`), manifest checks, and team-agents parallel groups (real
> team agents, not subagents) with sequential fallback, each on demand. A
> **legacy** plan (three final tasks) resumes under its own shape — resume never
> migrates it.

### Step 6 — Handle Blockers
If a task log or `state.json.blocked` shows a blocker, read it, fix the issue
within the task's authorized scope, re-run only the affected validations; on
pass: clear `blocked`, mark `[x]`, commit, continue; on fail: log again, stop,
request help (unattended: halt with `blocked` updated).

### Step 7 — Progress Reporting
After resuming and completing a task, show the compact result of
`../execute/SKILL.md` Step 6 (`✓ Resumed and completed: Task N` …). On blocker:
`✗ Task N blocked` with the blocker, action taken, status, and next step.

## The handoff artifact (what every session leaves behind)

Before yielding — at the end of a task, at a checkpoint before a planned
interruption, or when halting — the executing session **writes** (never only
says): the task's Completion & Log (or its partial notes), the README
checkboxes, the `PROGRESS.md` **Active context** block with the exact next
action and the evidence pointers, and `state.json` (`checkpoint` `{task, step,
at, note}` or `blocked`). That is the whole handoff: a fresh agent, another
model, or another harness resumes from these files with Step 2.

## Persistence: same workspace, new machine, or nothing to resume

- **Same workspace:** the handoff artifacts above are already on disk; Step 2
  is the whole recovery.
- **New machine / fresh clone:** `.dwp/` is gitignored by design, so a fresh
  `git clone` carries **no** plan data — report that honestly, never
  fabricate progress from commits. Transfer is explicit and manual
  (`../shared/dwp-paths.md`, "Workspace persistence and transfer"): copy the
  **whole plan folder** — README, task files, `PROGRESS.md`, `manifest.json`,
  `state.json`, and `analysis_results/` with every cited gate log — check out
  the recorded repository revision, and re-create the dirty work the
  checkpoint names. The minimum handoff manifest: the complete plan folder,
  evidence pointers, repository revision(s), and required dirty work.
- **Missing artifacts** (no plan folder, absent state, dangling `log=` pointer):
  report what is missing and stop at that boundary; never reconstruct history
  from memory. No daemon, auto-upload, or automatic unignoring of `.dwp/`
  exists — persistence is a deliberate copy.

## Important Notes
- **Legacy plans:** execute as recorded; no automatic lifecycle migration.

## Error Handling
- Invalid plan structure → report; ask to fix (`refine`) or proceed with caution.
- Missing task file → report; ask whether to skip or create (unattended: blocker).
- Unclear git state → report findings; ask before proceeding (unattended: §7.3
  boundary).
- Contradictory checkpoint / summary vs files → trust the files; record; continue
  from the evidence.
- Unresolvable blocker → log in Completion & Log; report; wait for guidance.
