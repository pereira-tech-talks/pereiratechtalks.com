# Task {N}: Create Child DWP — {Repository Name}

> **Template for orchestrator plans.** Replace all `{placeholders}` when generating a real task file.

## 1. Context

**Plan Type:** Orchestrator — Child DWP Creation
**Target Repository:** `repositories/{repo_name}/`
**Child Plan Name:** `PLAN_{feature}_{repo_short}`

This task creates a complete DWP plan inside `repositories/{repo_name}/` that implements the {repo_name}-specific portion of the overall feature. The child DWP will follow {repo_name}'s own AGENTS.md, validation commands, and conventions.

### Orchestrator Context

- **Parent Plan:** PLAN_{parent_plan_name} (this plan, in Core Hub)
- **Feature:** {overall feature description}
- **This repo's role:** {what this repo contributes — e.g., "CRUD API endpoints for user preferences"}
- **Depends on:** {list child plans that must complete first, or "None — this is the first child DWP"}
- **Depended on by:** {list child plans that depend on this one's outputs, or "None"}
- **Manifest:** `.dwp/plans/PLAN_{parent_plan_name}/ORCHESTRATOR_MANIFEST.md` {or "Not used"}

### Input Dependencies (from predecessors)

{If this child has predecessors, list what outputs it expects from them:}
- From PLAN_{feature}_{predecessor_short}: {the concrete artifacts that plan declared — e.g., "analysis_results/API_CONTRACT.md with endpoint definitions and data model schemas"}
- {Or "None — this is the first child DWP in the dependency chain"}

### Output Declarations (for successors)

{What this child DWP is expected to produce for downstream consumers:}
- Declared output artifacts: {the exact files this child will write for downstream use — e.g., "analysis_results/API_CONTRACT.md: endpoint paths, request/response schemas, data model definitions"}
- Key outputs: {specific outputs — e.g., "API endpoint URLs, error response formats, pagination patterns"}
- {Or "None — no downstream child DWPs depend on this one's outputs"}

### Expected Child DWP Scope

The child DWP should cover approximately {N} tasks, including:
- {high-level task 1 — e.g., "Add data model and migration"}
- {high-level task 2 — e.g., "Create serializer/validation"}
- {high-level task 3 — e.g., "Add API views/endpoints"}
- {high-level task 4 — e.g., "Security hardening pass over the new endpoints"}
- {high-level task 5 — e.g., "Write comprehensive tests"}
- {high-level task 6 — e.g., "Update documentation"}
- Plus the single mandatory Final Review (security pass + final-state validation + skills reconciliation + documentation reconciliation)

## 2. Read Before Starting

**CRITICAL — Read target repo documentation first:**

1. `repositories/{repo_name}/AGENTS.md` — Rules, validation commands, tech stack, conventions
2. `repositories/{repo_name}/guide/GUIDE.md` — DWP guide (if exists)

**If DWP system doesn't exist in target repo:**
- Bootstrap it following Core Hub's guide as template
- Create: `.dwp/` folder structure with adapted GUIDE
- Adapt validation commands and conventions to the target repo's tech stack

**From parent plan (if applicable):**
- {Previous task} Completion & Log: {what to extract, e.g., "API contract decisions from design task"}
- {Previous task} Outputs: {e.g., "analysis_results/API_CONTRACT.md"}

## 3. Goal

Create a complete, executable DWP plan inside `repositories/{repo_name}/` that:
- Implements {repo-specific goal — e.g., "user preferences CRUD API with model, serializer, views, and tests"}
- Follows {repo_name}'s AGENTS.md rules and conventions
- Uses {repo_name}'s validation commands (e.g., `{validation_command}`)
- Contains approximately {N} atomic tasks plus mandatory final tasks
- Can be executed independently by an agent working in that repository
- References the parent orchestrator plan for context

## 4. Instructions

> **Before starting:** Re-read the plan README section 1 (Goal) to ensure this task's work aligns with the overall objective.

### Step 1: Read the Orchestrator Context Manifest and navigate to target repository

**Read the Orchestrator Context Manifest first (if it exists):**
- Read `ORCHESTRATOR_MANIFEST.md` from the parent plan folder
- Extract: shared context (design decisions, API contracts, global constraints)
- Note the dependency graph and this repo's position in it
- Note what predecessor outputs this child DWP will need (Input Dependencies)
- Note what outputs this child DWP must produce (Output Declarations)

**Navigate to target repository:**
```bash
# Save the Core Hub root before entering the child — resolving the git root
# while inside the child would return the child, not the hub.
HUB_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"

# Enter the child by its REGISTERED root (from ORCHESTRATOR_MANIFEST.md).
# repositories/{repo_name}/ is the convention, not a hardcoded requirement.
cd repositories/{repo_name}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Do not carry a hub `DWP_DIR` into the child: resolve the child's `.dwp/` in a
> subshell with `unset DWP_DIR`, or set an explicitly recorded child-specific
> override.

Read the following files completely:
- **`AGENTS.md`** — Extract and note:
  - Validation commands (e.g., `codecheck -f`, `npm run test && npm run eslint:check`)
  - Test file naming convention (e.g., `*.spec.ts`, `*_test.py`)
  - Linting command (e.g., `npm run eslint:check`, `codecheck -f`)
  - Test command (e.g., `npm run test`, `pytest`)
  - Package manager (npm, Poetry, etc.)
  - Docker requirements (e.g., API Services must run inside Docker)
  - Commit format and scope conventions
  - Import order rules, code style rules

- **`guide/GUIDE.md`** (if exists) — Note any repo-specific DWP conventions

- **Architecture documentation** — Any relevant patterns or conventions docs

### Step 2: Design the child DWP tasks

Based on this repo's role in the feature, break down the work into atomic tasks:
- Each task should have one clear objective
- Tasks should be ordered by dependency
- Each task should be independently completable
- Include validation using the target repo's commands

**{repo_type}-specific task patterns:**

{Include the appropriate pattern based on repo type:}

**For API repos (Django/Python):**
1. Model/migration
2. Serializer
3. View/endpoint
4. URL routing
5. Tests
6. Documentation

**For Web repos (Vue/TypeScript):**
1. API client/service layer
2. Pinia store / state management
3. Component(s)
4. View/route
5. Tests
6. Documentation

**For Chatbot repos (Node.js/TypeScript):**
1. Handler
2. Parser / intent recognition
3. Response builder
4. Tests
5. Documentation

**For Gateway repos (Express/TypeScript):**
1. Command registration
2. Handler implementation
3. Response formatting
4. Tests
5. Documentation

### Step 3: Create the child DWP plan

Create the plan at:
```
repositories/{repo_name}/.dwp/plans/PLAN_{feature}_{repo_short}/
```

Create all required files:

**README.md:**
```markdown
# Plan: {Feature Title} — {Repo Name}

> This is a child DWP created by orchestrator plan `PLAN_{parent_plan_name}` in the Core Hub.

## 1. Goal
{Repo-specific goal}

## 2. Context
{Tech stack and context from the repo's AGENTS.md}

## 3. Global Guidelines
{Guidelines from the repo's AGENTS.md — validation, linting, commit format}

## 4. Task List & Links
- [ ] Task 1: {title}
      See: [1.task_{name}.md](./1.task_{name}.md)
...
- [ ] Task N: Final Review
      See: [{N}.task_final_review.md](./{N}.task_final_review.md)

## 5. Execution Rules for the Agent
{Standard execution rules}

## 6. Orchestrator Context

> This child DWP is part of orchestrator plan `PLAN_{parent_plan_name}` in the Core Hub.

### Parent Plan Reference
- **Parent Plan:** PLAN_{parent_plan_name}
- **Parent Location:** `.dwp/plans/PLAN_{parent_plan_name}/` (in the Core Hub)
- **Manifest:** `.dwp/plans/PLAN_{parent_plan_name}/ORCHESTRATOR_MANIFEST.md` (in the Core Hub)
- **This repo's role:** {what this repo contributes}
- **Dependencies:** {which child plans must complete first}

### Shared Context (from parent plan)
<!-- Snapshot of key shared context at child DWP creation time -->

**Key decisions:**
- {Decision 1 from parent plan — e.g., "Use JSON field for preferences storage"}
- {Decision 2 from parent plan — e.g., "REST API endpoints at /api/v1/preferences/"}

**API contract summary (if applicable):**
- {Endpoint/method/path summaries relevant to this repo}

**Global constraints:**
- {Constraint 1 — e.g., "All field names in snake_case"}
- {Constraint 2 — e.g., "Error responses follow standard format"}

### Input Dependencies

{If this child DWP has predecessors, execution is BLOCKED until inputs are available:}

> ⚠️ **EXECUTION BLOCKED** until all inputs are available.

| Predecessor | Status | Declared Output Path |
|-------------|--------|----------------------|
| PLAN_{feature}_{predecessor_short} | [ ] Ready | `repositories/{predecessor_repo}/.dwp/plans/PLAN_{feature}_{predecessor_short}/analysis_results/{declared_artifact}` |

**Before starting execution:**
1. Verify the predecessor plan is complete (`state.json` → `status: completed`) and each declared artifact above exists
2. Read those artifacts — extract API endpoints, data models, key decisions
3. If a declared artifact is missing, STOP and report: "Cannot start — waiting for {predecessor} to complete"
4. Use predecessor context throughout execution, especially for integration-related tasks

{Or if no predecessors: "None — this child DWP has no predecessors and can execute immediately."}

### Expected Outputs

{What this child DWP must produce for downstream consumers:}
- **Declared artifacts:** `analysis_results/{file}` — {what each contains for downstream use}
- **Key outputs for successors:** {e.g., "API endpoint definitions, data model schemas, error handling patterns"}
- **Executive Report:** only if this orchestrator explicitly requested one when creating this child; it is optional under DWP 2.3.0 and is never assumed to exist.
- {Or "No downstream consumers — this is the last child DWP in the chain."}

## 7. Plan Status / Notes
- Created: {date}
- Status: Not started — 0/{N} tasks completed

## 8. Quick Reference
See [PROMPTS.md](./PROMPTS.md) for ready-to-use prompts.
```

**Task files (`N.task_{title}.md`):**
- Use the target repo's validation commands (NOT the Core Hub's)
- Use the target repo's test naming patterns
- Use the target repo's commit format and scope
- Include re-anchoring instruction in each task
- Include Execution Checklist with Dailybot reporting step

**PROMPTS.md** — Using the target repo's template if available, or Core Hub's
**PROGRESS.md** — Initial template
**analysis_results/** — Empty folder (with .gitkeep)
**Mandatory final task** — the single Final Review, last (`{N}.task_final_review.md`)

### Step 4: Return to Core Hub and update orchestrator tracking

```bash
cd "$HUB_ROOT"  # Return to the SAVED Core Hub root (never a hardcoded path)
```

Update the orchestrator plan's README.md:
