# AGENT_PROTOCOL.md — Cross-Agent Behavior Specification

## Abstract

This document specifies the cross-agent behavior required of any AI coding agent
operating in a DeepWorkPlan-conformant repository: which agents are supported, how
each invokes commands, how all agents read the same shared configuration, and what
progress-reporting behavior is expected. It is the normative companion to
`DOCUMENTATION_STANDARD.md` (what structure exists) and `DWP_SPECIFICATION.md` (how
plans execute).

The governing principle is **one source of truth, many agents**: `AGENTS.md` and
the `.agents/` directory are agent-neutral and shared; each agent reaches them
through its own native convention. The protocol applies to **both archetypes**
(`ARCHETYPES.md`).

## Status of This Document

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Version** | 2.3.0 |
| **Status** | Stable |
| **Supersedes** | `AGENT_PROTOCOL.md` 2.2.0; `PLAN_build_deepworkplan_brand/.../deepworkplan/spec/AGENT_PROTOCOL.md` (v1.0.0) |
| **Companions** | `DOCUMENTATION_STANDARD.md`, `DWP_SPECIFICATION.md`, `ARCHETYPES.md`, `ADDONS.md`, `PLAN_STATE.md` |
| **License** | MIT |

> **Additive in 2.2.0.** Two additions, no breaking changes: (1) **autonomous
> agent platforms** (OpenClaw, Hermes — daemon-style agents that load skills via
> the AgentSkills standard) join the supported-agents table; (2) the new
> **Execution Profiles** section (§7) specifies unattended execution — bounded
> authority, mandatory state layer, stop conditions, and scheduled continuation —
> for plans that run for hours without a human watching.

> **Divergence from v1 (overview).** v1's `AGENT_PROTOCOL.md` governed the
> *initialization* flow under an "agent-as-runtime, WebFetch on demand" model
> (model tiers, token-budget announcement, WebFetch-failure recovery). v2 reframes
> the protocol around an **installed skill** and a **shared `.agents/` surface**:
> the six supported agents, the `/` vs `#` command mapping, shared reading, and
> cross-agent progress reporting. The model-capability, approval-gate, validation,
> and privacy expectations from v1 are kept by reference and condensed
> (`RECONCILIATION.md` divergences #1, #2; "INIT/router" change row).

## 1. Conventions

The RFC 2119 keywords (**MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **MAY**,
**REQUIRED**, **OPTIONAL**) are interpreted as in
[RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

---

## 2. Supported Agents

This methodology **MUST** support the following AI coding agents. Any future
agent that reads markdown and can execute tool calls **MAY** be added without a
breaking change.

| Agent | Native config convention | Command prefix |
|-------|--------------------------|----------------|
| **Claude Code** | `.claude/` (symlinked to `.agents/`), `CLAUDE.md` (symlinked to `AGENTS.md`) | `/` (native) |
| **Cursor** | `.cursor/` (symlinked to `.agents/`), `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` | `#` or plain text |
| **OpenAI Codex** | `.codex/` / `CODEX.md` referencing `AGENTS.md` | `#` or plain text |
| **Google Gemini** | `.gemini/` referencing `AGENTS.md` | `#` or plain text |
| **GitHub Copilot** | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` referencing `AGENTS.md` | `#` or plain text |
| **Antigravity** | `.antigravity/` referencing `AGENTS.md` | `#` or plain text |
| **OpenClaw** | Natively scans `<workspace>/.agents/skills/` (AgentSkills standard) | plain text |
| **Hermes** | AgentSkills-standard skill loading; reads `AGENTS.md` | plain text |

The first six are **interactive coding agents** (a human in the session). OpenClaw
and Hermes are **autonomous agent platforms** — long-lived daemons with scheduled
turns — and typically execute plans under the **unattended profile** (§7) inside
an **agent workspace** (`ARCHETYPES.md` §4).

- Every supported agent **MUST** treat `AGENTS.md` as the single source of truth
  for repository conventions; a per-agent config file **MUST** reference it and
  **MUST NOT** duplicate its content (`DOCUMENTATION_STANDARD.md` §2.5).
- A model used to run DeepWorkPlan work **MUST** be reasoning-capable
  (inspecting many files, stack detection, self-validation, failure recovery);
  speed/cost-tier models **SHOULD NOT** be used for plan creation or repo onboarding.

---

## 3. Command Invocation Mapping (`/` vs `#`)

Commands live as markdown procedure files in `.agents/commands/` and are catalogued
in `.agents/docs/COMMANDS_REFERENCE.md`.

- **Claude Code** **MUST** invoke commands with the native `/` prefix
  (e.g. `/dwp-create`, `/dwp-execute`).
- **Cursor, Codex, Gemini, Copilot, and other non-Claude agents** **MUST** invoke
  commands with the `#` prefix (e.g. `#dwp-create`) or as plain text
  (e.g. "run dwp-create"). These CLIs intercept `/` as their own system prefix, so
  `/` **MUST NOT** be assumed available outside Claude Code.
- When a user's message begins with `#{command}` (or names a command), the agent
  **MUST** treat it as a command invocation.

On any command invocation, an agent **MUST**:

1. **Look up** the command (without its prefix) in `.agents/docs/COMMANDS_REFERENCE.md`
   to find its procedure file.
2. **Read** that procedure file completely.
3. **Follow** its steps exactly.
4. **MUST NOT** improvise, skip steps, or substitute remembered behavior — the
   procedure file is the spec.

> **Divergence from v1.** v1 documented the `/` vs `#` distinction inside per-agent
> adapter manifests. v2 makes it a **single normative mapping** in this protocol and
> ties it to the shared `.agents/commands/` + `COMMANDS_REFERENCE.md` surface
> (`RECONCILIATION.md` "adapters" change row).

---

## 4. Shared `.agents/` Reading

- All supported agents **MUST** read the same configuration content from `.agents/`
  (agents, commands, skills, docs, settings), each through its own convention:
  Claude Code via `.claude → .agents` and Cursor via `.cursor → .agents`
  (`DOCUMENTATION_STANDARD.md` §6), others via their referencing config files.
- `.agents/` content **MUST** be authored agent-neutral. An agent **MUST NOT**
  introduce agent-specific divergence into shared files; agent-only settings (e.g.
  Claude Code's `settings.json` harness config) **MUST** be ignored by agents that
  do not consume them.
- The DWP skill (`.agents/skills/deepworkplan/`) and any other skill packs **MUST**
  be consumable by every supported agent through the skill's own `SKILL.md` router.

---

## 5. Progress Reporting

- Agents **SHOULD** report progress after significant work (a feature, a bug fix, a
  completed DWP plan, a migration, or substantial multi-commit work), framed as what
  the human accomplished. Trivial, read-only, or rolled-back work **SHOULD NOT** be
  reported.
- Reporting **MUST NOT** block or delay the actual work: if the reporting channel
  fails, times out, or is unreachable, the agent **MUST** log the issue and continue.
  Progress reporting is important but secondary.
- This expectation applies cross-agent. The mechanism is repo-specific (e.g. the
  Dailybot repos use the `dailybot` skill) and is therefore part of the
  reason-per-repo 10% (`DOCUMENTATION_STANDARD.md` §7).
- Plan-completion reporting is independent of the optional Executive Report
  (`DWP_SPECIFICATION.md` §6.3): a completion report **MUST NOT** wait for, or
  require, an Executive Report, and **MUST** be derived from the plan's durable
  evidence (state layer, task logs), never from a report that may not exist.

---

## 6. Preserved v1 Expectations (by reference)

The following v1 behaviors are **kept** and apply during onboarding and plan
execution: read-before-action repository analysis; explicit user approval before
**destructive** actions (overwriting or deleting existing files); validation before
marking work complete (`DWP_SPECIFICATION.md` §5.1); and privacy — an agent **MUST
NOT** exfiltrate source/secrets and **MUST NOT** write literal secret values into
generated documentation. See `RECONCILIATION.md` non-divergences.

---

### 6.1. Autonomous work within existing authority

Agents **SHOULD** follow the repository's working principles
(`DOCUMENTATION_STANDARD.md` §2.3.1), authored from
[`../shared/working-principles.md`](../shared/working-principles.md). Investigate
before asking, make routine decisions within scope, reuse valid authorization,
and carry the requested outcome through proportionate validation. Escalation
**SHOULD** identify the missing decision or approval and include a recommendation.

These principles apply during ordinary tasks as well as DWP flows. They grant
no new permissions: analysis stays analysis; plan approval, gates, read-only
routes, and the unattended stop conditions in §7 remain authoritative. An
agent **MUST NOT** use "continue independent work" to execute later plan tasks
after a stop condition requires halting the plan. Honest reporting of a
blocker takes precedence over a claim of successful completion.

## 7. Execution Profiles

Every plan executes under exactly one of two profiles. The profile changes *who
watches*, never *what gates apply* — validation discipline
(`DWP_SPECIFICATION.md` §5.1) is identical in both.

### 7.1. Interactive (default)

A human is present in the session. The agent proposes, the human approves the
ready Lite plan (guided mode) or waives the review with `trust`
(`DWP_SPECIFICATION.md` §3), the agent executes task-by-task, and genuine
ambiguity is resolved by asking. Within an approved plan the agent **SHOULD**
proceed from a passing gate to the next task without asking for confirmation
(`DWP_SPECIFICATION.md` §6.4). Everything in this protocol so far describes the
interactive profile.

### 7.2. Unattended

The plan runs with no human watching — an autonomous platform's scheduled turn,
a cloud session, an overnight run. Unattended execution is **opt-in per plan**
and **MUST** satisfy all of the following:

- **Pre-approved plan.** A human approved the plan before any unattended turn —
  either by approving the materialized plan (guided mode) or by creating it with
  `trust` (`DWP_SPECIFICATION.md` §3): **a `trust` instruction is plan approval.**
  What an agent **MUST NOT** do is create *and* execute a plan unattended with no
  human instruction at all; the human's create-time decision is the control point,
  and it is recorded in the plan README and, where present, the manifest.
- **State layer REQUIRED.** The plan **MUST** carry `manifest.json` and
  `state.json` (`PLAN_STATE.md` §2.1) so any later session — agent or human —
  can read exact progress without replaying a transcript.
- **Known standard.** Before the first unattended turn the agent **MUST**
  establish which standard the plan executes (`PLAN_STATE.md` §6.1) and **MUST**
  execute a legacy plan under its recorded shape (`DWP_SPECIFICATION.md` §6.5);
  a plan newer than the installed spec is a stop condition (§7.3), reported
  honestly, never guessed at.
- **Bounded authority.** The agent's authority is the plan: it **MUST NOT**
  expand scope, **MUST NOT** perform destructive or outward-facing actions the
  plan does not explicitly authorize (force-pushes, deletions outside listed
  paths, publishing, messaging third parties), and **MUST NOT** stretch a task's
  instructions to cover discovered-but-unplanned work — discovered work is
  recorded for the next `refine`, not improvised.
- **One atomic task per turn, gates always.** Each turn runs the DWP Resume
  Protocol (`DWP_SPECIFICATION.md` §5.3), executes at most the next task,
  passes its validation gate, completes per §5.2, and yields. A failing gate is
  a stop condition, never a "continue anyway".
- **No questions between tasks.** Within the plan's authority the agent **MUST
  NOT** pause to ask whether to continue, whether to run a gate, or whether to
  commit; it continues until a §7.3 condition or plan completion. Repairs within
  a task's authorized scope are attempted before a gate failure becomes a stop
  (`DWP_SPECIFICATION.md` §6.4).
- **No optional artifacts by default.** The Executive Report offer
  (`DWP_SPECIFICATION.md` §6.3) cannot be answered in an unattended run, so the
  report is **not** generated and the plan is nonetheless complete; the agent
  records that the offer was not answered and completes per §6.1.

### 7.3. Stop Conditions and Escalation

An unattended agent **MUST** halt the plan — populate `state.json.blocked`
(`PLAN_STATE.md` §4.4) with the task, the reason, and what it needs, then stop —
when any of these occur:

1. A validation gate fails and the fix is not already within the task's scope.
2. The task requires an approval, credential, or decision the plan did not
   pre-authorize.
3. Reality diverges from the plan's assumptions (missing file, changed API,
   conflicting concurrent work, §5.2 desync that reconciliation cannot resolve,
   or a plan that declares a standard newer than the installed skill).
4. Two consecutive turns make no verifiable progress on the same task.

An unanswered optional-artifact offer, a missing optional tool or addon, or an
unavailable reporting channel is **not** a stop condition: the agent records it
and continues (`DWP_SPECIFICATION.md` §6.3, `ADDONS.md`).

Halting is success, not failure: the blocked record is the escalation message.
The platform's notification channel (heartbeat report, progress report per §5)
**SHOULD** surface it; the human (or a `refine` session) unblocks, and the next
scheduled turn resumes normally.

### 7.4. Scheduled Continuation

On platforms with scheduling (OpenClaw heartbeat/cron, Hermes cron, cloud-agent
wake), continuation **MUST** be expressed as: *wake → run the DWP Resume
Protocol → if `blocked`, report and yield → else execute the next atomic task →
update the state layer → yield.* The plan, not the session, is the unit of
continuity; a plan **MUST** survive the platform restarting, the model changing,
or a different agent picking up the next turn. Every resumed action is
**idempotent** (`PLAN_STATE.md` §5.1): a turn that wakes after an interruption
inspects the actual evidence and completes only what is missing — it never
repeats a commit, a gate with unchanged inputs, or a report already sent.

Because `.dwp/` is gitignored by design, a workspace that was recreated —
fresh clone, new machine, recycled container — **MUST** have the state layer
transferred in before resuming (`shared/dwp-paths.md` "Workspace persistence
and transfer"). A checkout without plan data **MUST** report missing recovery
data and halt; it **MUST NOT** fabricate progress from commits. Transfer is
an explicit, manual step: no daemon, auto-upload, or automatic unignoring of
`.dwp/` is part of this methodology.
