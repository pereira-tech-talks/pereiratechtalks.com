# DeepWorkPlan — Create

Create a new Deep Work Plan through a smooth, unified flow: the developer
provides information once, you generate a **single refined draft**, the developer
reviews it, and you materialize the final plan under `.dwp/plans/PLAN_{name}/`.

> **Single-step change (vs legacy):** DeepWorkPlan generates the **refined draft
> directly**. There is **no separate raw-draft file**. This replaces the legacy
> draft → refined-draft two-step (which wrote `PLAN_{name}_draft.md` and then
> `PLAN_{name}_draft_refined.md`). The only reviewable draft artifact is now
> `.dwp/drafts/PLAN_{name}_draft_refined.md`.

## Philosophy

The goal is a delightful, smooth experience. The user provides information once;
the system handles all intermediate steps (refined-draft creation, review, final
plan generation) automatically.

## Shared resources (read these)

- [`../shared/context.sh`](../shared/context.sh) — resolve repo root, branch,
  agent tool, and the `.dwp/` output location (`dwp_dir`).
- [`../shared/dwp-paths.md`](../shared/dwp-paths.md) — the `.dwp/plans/` +
  `.dwp/drafts/` output convention.
- [`../shared/adaptation.md`](../shared/adaptation.md) — reasoning-over-copy-paste
  and the two repository archetypes (individual repo vs orchestrator hub).
- [`../guide/GUIDE.md`](../guide/GUIDE.md) — the full methodology: plan README
  structure, task-file anatomy, mandatory final tasks, orchestrator (§13),
  team agents (§14).
- [`../examples/CREATE_PLAN.md`](../examples/CREATE_PLAN.md) — prompt patterns.
- [`../examples/PROMPTS_TEMPLATE.md`](../examples/PROMPTS_TEMPLATE.md) — the
  `PROMPTS.md` template for each plan.

## Parameter Reference

| Input | Classification | Mode | Behavior | Example |
|-------|---------------|------|----------|---------|
| (none) | — | guided | Ask for name, then ask questions | `/dwp-create` |
| `{short text}` | **name-only** | guided | Extract name, ask questions immediately | `/dwp-create improve error handling` |
| `{long text}` | **full-context** | guided | Infer name, proceed to refined draft directly | `/dwp-create Refactor auth to use JWT across all services. Currently using sessions...` |
| `trust` or `auto` | — | trust | Ask for name, then ask questions (no confirmations) | `/dwp-create trust` |
| `{short text} trust` | **name-only** | trust | Extract name, ask questions (no confirmations) | `/dwp-create improve-error-handling trust` |
| `{long text} trust` | **full-context** | trust | Infer name, proceed directly (no confirmations) | `/dwp-create Refactor auth... trust` |
| `refined-draft {name}` | — | refined-draft-only | Produce ONLY the refined draft (no final plan) | `/dwp-create refined-draft my_plan` |
| `from-refined-draft {file}` | — | from-refined-draft | Build final plan from an existing refined draft | `/dwp-create from-refined-draft PLAN_x_draft_refined.md` |
| `from {file}` | — | from-refined-draft | Alias for `from-refined-draft` | `/dwp-create from PLAN_x_draft_refined.md` |

> **Name format:** users type names in any format; you auto-convert to
> `snake_case` internally.

## Modes

### Guided Mode (default)
- Collects information from the user.
- Creates the **refined draft** → shows it for review.
- Asks for confirmation before creating the final plan.
- User can request adjustments before final generation.

### Trust Mode (`trust` or `auto`)
- Collects information from the user.
- Creates the **refined draft** → final plan automatically (no intermediate
  confirmations).

## Unified Workflow

### Step 0 — Parse Parameters & Determine Mode

**0.1 Detect trust mode:** if the LAST word is `trust` or `auto`, remove it and
set `trust_mode = true`; otherwise `false`.

**0.2 Detect special modes (check FIRST word):**
- `refined-draft` → `mode = "refined-draft-only"`, remaining text = plan name.
- `from-refined-draft` or `from` → `mode = "from-refined-draft"`, remaining text
  = refined-draft file path.
- Otherwise → continue to input classification (0.3).

**0.3 Classify remaining input:**

| Condition | Classification | What to do |
|-----------|---------------|------------|
| No remaining text | **no input** | Go to Step 1, then Step 2 (ask for name + all info) |
| ≤10 words AND no complete sentences AND no line breaks | **name-only** | Convert to snake_case → plan name. Go to Step 1, then Step 2 (skip name question) |
| >10 words OR detailed sentences OR line breaks | **full-context** | Infer plan name → snake_case. Go to Step 1, then Step 3 (use provided context) |

**Name auto-conversion to snake_case:** lowercase; replace hyphens/spaces with
`_`; strip everything but `a-z0-9_`. Examples: `improve Feature X` →
`improve_feature_x`, `add-stripe-payments` → `add_stripe_payments`.

> **CRITICAL:** when input is **name-only**, NEVER explore the codebase or
> research the topic before asking questions. The name only says what to CALL the
> plan, not what to DO. Go directly to Step 2.

**Routing by mode:**
- `from-refined-draft` → skip to Step 4.3.
- `refined-draft-only` → gather info, create only the refined draft, skip final
  plan creation.
- `no input` / `name-only` → Step 1, then Step 2.
- `full-context` → Step 1, then Step 3.

### Step 1 — Quick Introduction

Show a brief intro matching the mode (guided vs trust): what will happen and that
you'll create a refined plan, review it (guided) or proceed (trust), then
generate the final executable plan.

### Step 2 — Gather Information (Conversational)

> Skip this entire step for `full-context` input — go straight to Step 3.

Collect, conversationally:
- **2.1 Plan name** (skip if already extracted) — auto-convert to snake_case, add
  `PLAN_` prefix internally.
- **2.2 Objective** — one or two sentences.
- **2.3 Context** — where the changes live, constraints/rules, tech notes.
- **2.4 Tasks** — at least 2; if only 1, suggest breaking it down.
- **2.5 Guidelines (optional)** — branch/commit format, coverage target, etc.

**2.6 Orchestrator detection (automatic).** After 2.3–2.4, auto-detect an
**orchestrator plan** when: the work spans 2+ sub-repositories with independent
feature work, or the user explicitly mentions child DWPs / orchestrator /
"create plans in each repo". If detected, offer the choice between an
**orchestrator plan** (creates child DWPs per repo, each following its own
`AGENTS.md`) and a **direct multi-project plan**. See `../guide/GUIDE.md` §13 and
`../shared/adaptation.md` (orchestrator-hub archetype).

**2.7–2.9 (orchestrator only):** ask for target repositories (note each repo
root — for an orchestrator hub this is `repositories/{repo}/`), dependency order,
and execution mode (Distributed / Sequential with Output Handoff / Sequential
basic). Default to Distributed.

**2.10 Team-agents detection (automatic — always runs, non-orchestrator plans).**
Always analyze whether 2+ tasks touch different files/modules with no data
dependencies and would benefit from parallel execution. This is NOT opt-in.
- If parallelizable: in **guided** mode, inform the user (do not ask) and add the
  team-agents configuration; in **trust** mode, do it silently. Team-agents
  metadata is always additive and backward compatible (other agents ignore it).
- Auto-assign parallel groups (tasks with no cross-dependencies), teammate roles
  (derived from task content), and default model `sonnet`. Setup/integration and
  the three mandatory final tasks are always sequential.
- If not parallelizable: add nothing, mention nothing.

**Step 2.11 — Parallel Research Phase (Claude Code only, automatic).** Before
drafting, if the plan spans 2+ repos or several independent modules and context
isn't already provided, spawn **research teammates** (`subagent_type: "Explore"`,
one per repo/area) to read each `AGENTS.md`, identify relevant files, contracts,
and validation commands, then synthesize their findings into enriched context for
the refined draft. Skip for simple/single-module plans or full-context input.
Fallback: research sequentially if team agents are unavailable. In trust mode,
run silently.

### Step 3 — Create the Refined Draft (Automatic, SINGLE STEP)

> **This is the single-step change.** Produce the **refined draft directly** —
> one file, written straight to `.dwp/drafts/`. Do NOT create a separate raw
> `PLAN_{name}_draft.md` first.

Show a **2-step** progress UI:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Creating your plan...
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[1/2] Drafting refined plan...
```

**3.1 Write the refined draft:**
- Resolve `dwp_dir` via `../shared/context.sh`; ensure `<dwp_dir>/drafts/` exists.
- Compose a professional, complete plan prompt following
  `../examples/CREATE_PLAN.md`: objective, context (enriched with Step 2.11
  research if applicable), well-formed tasks, guidelines. Expand every section
  with full detail and clarity in one pass.
- Write **only**: `.dwp/drafts/PLAN_{name}_draft_refined.md`.

```
[1/2] Drafting refined plan... ✓
[2/2] Preparing for review...
```

### Step 4 — Review & Create Final Plan

#### 4.1 Guided Mode — Show for Review

Present a summary (objective, task count + list, location, constraints) and the
path `→ .dwp/drafts/PLAN_{name}_draft_refined.md`, then offer:
1. Looks good, create the final plan → Step 4.4.
2. Make adjustments → ask what to change, **edit the refined draft in place**,
   show the menu again.
3. Show the full refined draft → display it, then re-show the menu.
4. Stop here → completion message for the draft phase.

#### 4.2 Trust Mode — Automatic Continue

Skip review; go directly to Step 4.4. Progress: `[2/2] Creating final plan...`.

#### 4.3 From-Refined-Draft Mode

- Validate the file exists in `.dwp/drafts/`. If not found, list available
  refined drafts and ask the user to select.
- Read it; extract plan name, objective, context, tasks, guidelines.
- Skip to Step 4.4.

#### 4.4 Create Final Plan

Follow `../guide/GUIDE.md`. Create:

1. **Folder:** `.dwp/plans/PLAN_{name}/`
2. **README.md** — Goal; Context; Plan Variables (optional); Global Guidelines;
   Task List with `[ ]` checkboxes + links (including the three mandatory final
   tasks); Execution Rules; Skills & Agents Used; Plan Status / Notes; Analysis
   Outputs (referencing `EXECUTIVE_REPORT.md`); Quick Reference to `PROMPTS.md`.
3. **PROMPTS.md** — from `../examples/PROMPTS_TEMPLATE.md`, replacing
   `{PLAN_NAME}`.
4. **PROGRESS.md** — initial template (Task Summaries / Key Decisions / Important
   Values & Paths).
5. **analysis_results/** — empty folder inside the plan directory.
6. **User-defined task files** — `N.task_{title}.md`, each with Context, Read
   Before Starting (optional), Goal, Instructions (with re-anchoring),
   Acceptance Criteria, Outputs (optional), Validation, Rollback (optional),
   Execution Checklist, Completion & Log. For any task that adds new core
   functionality or changes product behavior, bake the **test discipline** into
   it (`../guide/GUIDE.md` §5.3): its Acceptance Criteria **must** require
   automated test coverage for the new/changed behavior, and its Validation
   **must** run the repo's tests plus lint/type-check/format checks (not the
   build alone). Where related work is substantial, prefer a dedicated
   `N.task_add_tests_for_{feature}.md` task right after the implementation task.
   Likewise, for any task that touches auth, input handling, secrets/config,
   network surface, or dependencies, bake the **security discipline** into it
   (`../guide/GUIDE.md` §5.4); where the security-sensitive work is substantial,
   prefer a dedicated `N.task_security_hardening_{feature}.md` task placed after
   the implementation tasks and **before** the comprehensive-tests task, so
   findings are fixed before tests encode the behavior and become regression
   test cases rather than rework.

7. **State layer (RECOMMENDED, `../spec/PLAN_STATE.md`)** — write
   `manifest.json` (plan identity: name, archetype, rigor tier, spec version,
   task count, creating agent — once, never edited after) and the initial
   `state.json` (every task `pending`, empty gates). Both atomically
   (write-temp-then-rename). REQUIRED when the plan will run unattended
   (`../spec/AGENT_PROTOCOL.md` §7.2) or the workspace has no git.

**Proportional rigor check first (`../spec/DWP_SPECIFICATION.md` §11):** before
materializing anything, confirm the work actually warrants a plan. A trivial
single-concern change is **micro** tier — say that a plan is disproportionate,
offer to state goal + acceptance criteria + validation gate inline and just do
it. Declare the chosen tier (`standard` or `deep`) and why in the refined draft.

**Three mandatory final tasks (always):**
- **Security Review** (MANDATORY, **third-to-last**, task `N-2`,
  `{N-2}.task_security_review.md`): reviews the plan's full accumulated diff for
  hardcoded secrets, injection risks, unsafe input handling, new attack surface,
  and auth/permission changes; audits dependencies the plan introduced
  (best-effort, with the ecosystem's audit tooling where available); verifies
  `docs/SECURITY.md` still reflects reality and updates it when the plan changed
  secrets handling, the auth model, or data boundaries; writes
  `analysis_results/SECURITY_REVIEW.md` even when clean. A critical finding
  blocks completion until fixed or explicitly accepted by the user
  (`../spec/DWP_SPECIFICATION.md` §6.1).

  **Addon augmentation — `ai-diff-reviewer` (opt-in, only when installed).**
  When the target repo has installed the [`ai-diff-reviewer` addon](../addons/ai-diff-reviewer/SKILL.md) — detected via
  `.agents/skills/ai-diff-reviewer/` present + an extension file at one of the
  three recognized paths (in precedence order): `.review/extension.md`,
  `.github/ai-diff-reviewer/extension.md`, or the back-compat
  `.github/ai-pr-reviewer/extension.md` — the Security Review task template gains
  an ADDITIONAL post-existing-checks step: invoke the upstream skill's parent
  default flow ("Review my current branch" / `/ai-diff-reviewer`), capture the
  verdict, findings table, per-finding bodies, notes, and recommendation, and
  append them to `analysis_results/SECURITY_REVIEW.md` under a dedicated
  `## AI Diff Reviewer local review` heading.   The upstream skill's `prompt.md`
  is byte-identical to the CI Action's `prompts/default.md` at the same tag, so
  when the same repo also runs the CI Action (Flow B), the local review shares
  the same methodology and severity model via that prompt plus the extension
  file; CI round 2+ may surface a shorter finding set under Iteration-Aware
  Review (local stays a full pass — see addon SPEC §4.3). A `critical` finding
  follows the existing SR contract
  (blocks completion until fixed or explicitly accepted); `warning` / `info`
  findings are appended and reported but do not block. The augmentation is
  best-effort and conditional per the addon SPEC §7 (never-block rule): skip
  the **local** review pass (warn once, NEVER fail the task) only when the
  vendored skill is absent, detection fails (no extension file), or the local
  review invocation errors. Flow A needs **no** CI provider secret — do NOT
  treat an unset `CURSOR_API_KEY` (or other provider secret) as a reason to
  skip the local Security Review pass; that secret is Flow B CI / gate
  messaging only. **Flow B optional companion (not a plan task):**
  when the plan's PR has been pushed and CI has posted its review, the developer
  MAY invoke the upstream `apply-review` sub-skill from within the same
  `execute` session to walk through CI findings per-finding (apply / defer /
  skip) with explicit consent — read-only by default, edits require per-finding
  yes, never commits or pushes. This is surfaced as an available option during
  `execute`; the addon MUST NOT insert an `apply-review` task file into any
  plan (would violate the mandatory-final-task-order rule).
- **Skills & Agents Discovery** (MANDATORY, **second-to-last**, task `N-1`,
  `{N-1}.task_skills_agents_discovery.md`): reviews completed tasks for new
  patterns, checks the catalog, creates/updates skills/agents if warranted,
  evaluates the skills-generator system. If no skills-generator exists in the
  target repo, write a simplified evaluate-and-document-only version.
- **Executive Report** (MANDATORY, **last**, task `N`,
  `{N}.task_executive_report.md`): generates
  `analysis_results/EXECUTIVE_REPORT.md` with Executive Summary, Product Impact,
  Technical Details, QA Verification Guide, FAQs, Next Steps.

Add to the README a note: "Every plan includes Security Review
(third-to-last), Skills & Agents Discovery (second-to-last), and Executive
Report (last). These are auto-generated by `/dwp-create`."

**Quality gates:** atomic, ordered tasks; both mandatory files present;
`analysis_results/` exists; `PROGRESS.md` exists; numbering correct (user tasks →
security review → skills discovery → executive report); behavior-changing tasks carry test coverage
in their Acceptance Criteria and tests + lint/type-check in their Validation
(`../guide/GUIDE.md` §5.3).

**Accelerate generation with team agents (Claude Code only, automatic):** for
5+ user-defined task files, the lead creates README/PROMPTS/PROGRESS/
analysis_results + the mandatory final task files, then spawns teammates (1 per
2–3 task files) to write user task files in parallel (no file overlap), verifies
all files, and cleans up. Fallback: generate sequentially.

**Orchestrator additions (orchestrator plans):**
- README **Child DWP Plans** table (`# | Repository | Child Plan | Status |
  Depends On`), an **Execution Mode** subsection, and **Dependency Rules**.
- **ORCHESTRATOR_MANIFEST.md** at `.dwp/plans/PLAN_{name}/ORCHESTRATOR_MANIFEST.md`
  (template in `../guide/GUIDE.md` §13.8): Shared Context, Child DWP Registry,
  Dependency Graph, Output Contracts, Execution State.
- Task files: direct design tasks first (if hybrid); then `create_child_dwp`
  tasks in dependency order (template
  `../examples/ORCHESTRATOR_TASK_TEMPLATE_create_child_dwp.md`); optional
  `integration_checkpoint` tasks
  (`../examples/ORCHESTRATOR_TASK_TEMPLATE_integration_checkpoint.md`);
  `execute_child_dwp` tasks for Sequential-with-Output-Handoff mode
  (`../examples/ORCHESTRATOR_TASK_TEMPLATE_execute_child_dwp.md`); then the two
  mandatory final tasks last. Each `create_child_dwp` task instructs the agent to
  navigate to the target repo, read its `AGENTS.md`, and create a child DWP at
  `repositories/{repo}/.dwp/plans/PLAN_{child}/` using that repo's conventions.

**Team-agents metadata (when Step 2.10 detected parallelizable tasks):** add a
"Team Agents Configuration (Claude Code Only)" section to the README (Parallel
Task Groups + Teammate Roles tables) and a "Team Agents Metadata (Claude Code
Only)" section to each parallel task file (Parallel Group / Teammate Role / Can
Run With / Blocks / Files Owned). Use `../examples/TEAM_AGENTS_TASK_TEMPLATE.md`.
Rules: never put required info inside team-agents sections; every task must work
sequentially; mandatory final tasks are always sequential; file ownership between
parallel tasks must not overlap.

### Step 5 — Completion & Execute Option

For a full plan, report success and the location
`.dwp/plans/PLAN_{name}/`, then offer: (1) execute now → run the **Execute**
sub-skill (`../execute/SKILL.md`); (2) review the README first, then ask again;
(3) done for now → tell them to run `/dwp-execute {name}` later.

**Dailybot kickoff (only when the Dailybot addon is wired — best-effort,
non-blocking):** after the plan is materialized and approved, send a **regular**
(non-milestone) kickoff report via the dailybot `report` sub-skill — "Starting:
\<what is being built and why it matters\>" — per the addon's lifecycle event
model (`../addons/dailybot/SPEC.md` §5.1). One kickoff per plan; skip silently
if Dailybot is absent, unauthenticated, or `.dailybot/disabled` exists. Never
block on this.

For `refined-draft-only` mode, report the single refined draft saved at
`.dwp/drafts/PLAN_{name}_draft_refined.md` and the next step: run
`/dwp-create from PLAN_{name}_draft_refined.md` to build the final plan.

### Step 6 — Execute Plan (Optional)

If the user chose to execute, hand off to the **Execute** sub-skill
(`../execute/SKILL.md`): read the plan README, check git status, start from the
first `[ ]` task, execute sequentially, validate, commit per task, report.

## Error Handling

- **Plan name already exists:** offer different name / overwrite / cancel.
- **Name auto-converted:** show an informational notice (not an error).
- **Refined draft not found (from-refined-draft):** list available refined drafts
  in `.dwp/drafts/` and ask the user to choose.
- **Insufficient tasks (<2):** ask the user to break the work down.

## Important Notes

- **Git ignore:** everything under `.dwp/` is git-ignored.
- **Single artifact:** the only draft file is `PLAN_{name}_draft_refined.md` in
  `.dwp/drafts/` — there is no separate raw draft.
- **Reference:** follow `../guide/GUIDE.md`; orchestrator → §13; team agents → §14.
- **Archetypes:** orchestrator support assumes the orchestrator-hub archetype
  (sub-repos under `repositories/`); an individual repo creates standard plans.
  See `../shared/adaptation.md`.
