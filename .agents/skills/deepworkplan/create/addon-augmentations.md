# DeepWorkPlan — Create: the Final Review's local review step and addon augmentations (read when composing the Final Review)

This file is read when composing the Final Review task (`SKILL.md` Step 4.4 item 3): the AI Diff Reviewer local review is a required part of the security pass since standard 2.3.0, and other installed addons may augment it. Detection rules and the exact augmentation text are verbatim from the main procedure; the never-block rule of `../addons/README.md` applies.

## `ai-diff-reviewer`

**Required local review — `ai-diff-reviewer` (baseline since 2.3.0).**
The Final Review's security pass includes a post-existing-checks local-review
step defined by the [`ai-diff-reviewer` addon](../addons/ai-diff-reviewer/SKILL.md).
Detection: `.agents/skills/ai-diff-reviewer/` present + an extension file at
one of the three recognized paths (in precedence order): `.review/extension.md`,
`.github/ai-diff-reviewer/extension.md`, or the back-compat
`.github/ai-pr-reviewer/extension.md`. When both are present: invoke the upstream skill's parent
default flow ("Review my current branch" / `/ai-diff-reviewer`), capture the
verdict, findings table, per-finding bodies, notes, and recommendation, and
append them to `analysis_results/SECURITY_REVIEW.md` under a dedicated
`## AI Diff Reviewer local review` heading.   The upstream skill's `prompt.md`
is byte-identical to the CI Action's `prompts/default.md` at the same tag, so
when the same repo also runs the CI Action (Flow B), the local review shares
the same methodology and severity model via that prompt plus the extension
file; CI round 2+ may surface a shorter finding set under Iteration-Aware
Review (local stays a full pass — see addon SPEC §4.3). A `critical` finding
follows the existing security-pass contract
(blocks completion until fixed or explicitly accepted); `warning` / `info`
findings are appended and reported but do not block. A review that ran but
**wrote no findings file** is an **incomplete review**, not a clean pass
(upstream v2.2.0 posts it as one and fails every blocking strictness): record it
as incomplete, never count it as evidence the diff is clean, and never close the
Final Review on it (addon SPEC §6.1 item 5). Three states, three handlings —
absent reviewer, errored invocation, incomplete review — and none of them means
the diff is clean. Degradation is honest,
never silent (addon SPEC §6.1, §7): when the vendored skill or the extension
file is absent, record a `local reviewer not installed` finding in
`SECURITY_REVIEW.md`. Installation belongs to onboarding (`../onboard/addons.md`
Phase 7a — pinned skill, `generate-extension`) and is not a Final Review side
effect. Carry the finding into the completion report. When a review that could
start errors at invocation, warn once, record it
and continue; critical findings from a completed review still follow the normal
blocking contract. Flow A needs
**no** CI provider secret — do NOT
treat an unset `CURSOR_API_KEY` (or other provider secret) as a reason to
skip the local security pass; that secret is Flow B CI / gate
messaging only. **Flow B optional companion (not a plan task):**
when the plan's PR has been pushed and CI has posted its review, the developer
MAY invoke the upstream `apply-review` sub-skill from within the same
`execute` session to walk through CI findings per-finding (apply / defer /
skip) with explicit consent — read-only by default, edits require per-finding
yes, never commits or pushes. This is surfaced as an available option during
`execute`; the addon MUST NOT insert an `apply-review` task file into any
plan (would violate the single-Final-Review rule).

## Review scope is the plan's scope

Before invoking the upstream review, supply the plan's recorded starting revision
and the full accumulated diff for each affected repository, including staged,
unstaged and intended untracked files. Do not rely on a branch's tracking ref:
a pushed branch can have an empty upstream diff while still containing the plan's
changes. An empty default diff is not evidence of a completed review. Use the
upstream prompt and extension against the explicit plan diff; record the range,
working-tree fingerprint and any unavailable baseline. Reconcile source edits
made during review and rerun their affected gates before closure.

## Legacy plans

For a pre-2.3.0 plan, apply this same required local-review step to the
`{N-2}.task_security_review.md` task. If that task is already completed and the
plan is being explicitly migrated, preserve its completed contents and include
the local review in the new Final Review security pass instead; record a missing
reviewer finding there when the reviewer is unavailable. Never silently omit the
baseline because the plan retains its legacy final-task shape.
