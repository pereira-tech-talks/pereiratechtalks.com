# DeepWorkPlan — Verify (conformance check)

Check, objectively, whether a repository is **DeepWorkPlan-conformant** (AI-first
and agent-pilotable) and whether its Deep Work Plans are well-formed. This
sub-skill is **read-only**: it reports pass/fail, it does not change files. The
normative criteria are defined in the specification's Conformance document
(<https://deepworkplan.com/spec>).

## Shared resources (read these)

- [`../shared/context.sh`](../shared/context.sh) — resolve the repo root and `.dwp/`.
- [`../shared/dwp-paths.md`](../shared/dwp-paths.md) — plans live at `.dwp/plans/PLAN_{name}/`.
- [`conformance.sh`](conformance.sh) — the mechanical conformance layer (run it first).
- **Guide (essential — read for this flow):** none — the spec is the standard being checked.
- **Working principles (conditional):** read
  [`../shared/working-principles.md`](../shared/working-principles.md) when
  reviewing repository agent rules; no additional read for plan-only checks.
- **Spec (conditional — read the named sections only when the trigger fires):** [`../spec/PLAN_STATE.md`](../spec/PLAN_STATE.md) §4–§6 when interpreting a state-layer finding (desync, takeover, checkpoint evidence) or a declared-standard report — the checker enforces the contract; consult the spec when explaining or adjudicating a finding.
- **Guide (conditional — read only when the trigger fires):** [`../guide/structure.md`](../guide/structure.md) §1–§2 when a naming or layout finding needs the rationale.

## Run the mechanical layer first

Start every verification by running the automated checker — it covers the
structural checks below objectively, exits `0` (conformant) / `1` (findings) /
`2` (`UNVERIFIED` — plan structure could not be checked because Python 3.9+ is
missing; a CI gate must not treat that as success), and detects
markdown-vs-`state.json` desync:

```bash
bash {skill_dir}/verify/conformance.sh            # repo + every plan
bash {skill_dir}/verify/conformance.sh --repo-only
bash {skill_dir}/verify/conformance.sh --plan PLAN_{name}
```

The checker resolves the git root even when invoked from a subdirectory and
honors the absolute `DWP_DIR` override for repository, all-plan and named-plan
checks. An in-repository output directory must be gitignored; an external one
is already outside the checkout.

Exit codes are CI-friendly: `0` means the requested structural checks passed,
`1` means a conformance failure, and `2` means verification could not complete
(for example Python 3.9+ is unavailable for plan checks). Report `UNVERIFIED`,
never `CONFORMANT`, for missing tooling; do not install it inside this read-only
flow. Repository-only checks still run without Python. The checker accepts both plan lifecycle shapes (the 2.3.0 single Final Review and the pre-2.3.0 three-final-task ending) and reports harness-version findings for repositories onboarded under an earlier standard. It also verifies the documentation architecture where it is mechanically knowable (`../spec/DOCUMENTATION_STANDARD.md` §§2.1.1, 2.2, 4, 4.1): an `AGENTS.md` over the 500-line lean-index budget is reported as an advisory (SHOULD — authorship is not mechanically knowable); an `AGENTS.md` index link to a file that does not exist **fails**; and when `.dwp/onboard/RECON.md` carries an onboarding docs registry, a registered module without its `README.md` **fails** while a feature area recorded major without its `docs/` and a stale registry path are advisories — the registry is the repository's own recorded judgment, and with no registry no tier judgment is available, so nothing is reported. Then layer
the judgment checks (real commands, real toolchain, catalog-matches-disk) on
top — the script verifies *structure*; you verify *substance*.

## Parameter support

- `/dwp-verify` — verify the repository (the default).
- `/dwp-verify plan {name}` — also verify a specific plan's well-formedness.
- `/dwp-verify all` — verify the repository and every plan under `.dwp/plans/`.

## Trust boundary (write scope)

This skill is **read-only by contract**. `allowed-tools` lists `Bash` (to run
the repo's own read-only inspection and validation commands), not `Edit` or
`Write`: verification produces a **report**, never a repair.

**It MUST NOT:** create, modify, or delete any file; "fix" a failing criterion;
or let a failed check silently pass. Findings are reported with evidence and
fixed through the proper sub-skill (`onboard`, `refine`, or a plan).

## The overriding rule

Report what is **true on disk**, not what should be true. A criterion passes only
if the artifact exists *and* carries real, repository-specific content. A generic
stub, a placeholder, or a command that cannot run in this repository **fails** the
criterion — say so explicitly. Never mark a check passed without evidence.

## Repository checks

Run these from the repo root and record each result. Prefer the mechanical check;
fall back to reading the file when judgment is required (for example, deciding
whether `AGENTS.md` commands are real).

```bash
# 1. AGENTS.md at the root, with a Quick Commands block
test -f AGENTS.md && grep -qiE 'quick commands|## commands' AGENTS.md && echo "AGENTS.md: ok" || echo "AGENTS.md: FAIL"

# 2. CLAUDE.md resolves to AGENTS.md (symlink or equivalent single source)
[ -L CLAUDE.md ] && [ "$(readlink CLAUDE.md)" = "AGENTS.md" ] && echo "CLAUDE.md symlink: ok" || echo "CLAUDE.md symlink: CHECK"

# 3. docs/ with the standard categories
test -d docs && echo "docs/: present" || echo "docs/: FAIL"
for d in PRODUCT_SPEC ARCHITECTURE STANDARDS TESTING_GUIDE DEVELOPMENT_COMMANDS SECURITY AI_AGENT_ONBOARDING; do
  ls docs/ 2>/dev/null | grep -qi "$d" && echo "  docs/$d: ok" || echo "  docs/$d: missing"
done

# 4. .agents/ home with agents/ commands/ skills/ + a docs catalog; .claude resolves
for d in .agents/agents .agents/commands .agents/skills .agents/docs; do
  test -d "$d" && echo "$d: ok" || echo "$d: FAIL"
done
[ -e .claude ] && echo ".claude resolves: ok" || echo ".claude resolves: FAIL"
[ -e .cursor ] && echo ".cursor resolves: ok" || echo ".cursor resolves: FAIL"

# 5. dwp-* commands are thin delegators (≤ ~30 lines, reference the skill)
for f in .agents/commands/dwp-*.md; do
  [ -f "$f" ] || continue
  lines=$(wc -l < "$f")
  grep -qi 'deepworkplan' "$f" && [ "$lines" -le 40 ] && echo "$(basename "$f"): thin ok" || echo "$(basename "$f"): CHECK ($lines lines)"
done

# 6. .dwp/ gitignored with plans/; tmp/ gitignored
git check-ignore .dwp >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo ".dwp gitignored: ok" || echo ".dwp gitignored: FAIL"
test -d .dwp/plans && echo ".dwp structure: ok" || echo ".dwp structure: FAIL"
git check-ignore tmp >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "tmp gitignored: ok" || echo "tmp gitignored: SHOULD"

# 7. AI Diff Reviewer local review installed (required since DWP standard 2.3.0; a finding on legacy repos)
test -f .agents/skills/ai-diff-reviewer/SKILL.md && echo "ai-diff-reviewer skill: ok" || echo "ai-diff-reviewer skill: MISSING"
{ test -f .review/extension.md || test -f .github/ai-diff-reviewer/extension.md || test -f .github/ai-pr-reviewer/extension.md; } && echo "review extension: ok" || echo "review extension: MISSING"
```

Then, by reading rather than grepping:

- **Working principles.** Review `AGENTS.md` against
  `../shared/working-principles.md` and `DOCUMENTATION_STANDARD.md` §2.3.1.
  Accept equivalent wording under any heading; identify missing behavior or
  contradictory scope/approval instructions with evidence. Missing principles
  are an advisory harness-upgrade finding, not a structural failure. Do not
  rewrite the file in this read-only flow or infer model compliance from text.
- **Real commands.** Open `AGENTS.md` and confirm the Quick Commands actually correspond to this repo (the real package manager, test, lint, and build commands). Flag any command that could not run here.
- **Testing toolchain defined.** Open `docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md` and confirm it describes either a **real** test/lint setup (framework, file convention, how to run, coverage expectation) or — for a repo without one — a concrete **proposed** stack-appropriate setup (`../spec/DOCUMENTATION_STANDARD.md` §3.3). An empty file, a generic stub, or "no tests" **fails** this check: the repo then has no objective validation gate for future plans.
- **Repository standard and harness version.** `AGENTS.md` should carry a `DWP standard: X.Y.Z (…)` provenance line (`../spec/DOCUMENTATION_STANDARD.md` §3.5). A repository that **declares 2.3.0 or later** must have the §3.4 content in `docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md` (full and scoped commands with a repository example, source-to-test mapping, consumer policy, blind spots, escalation, explicit fallback, posture) — missing content **fails**. A repository with no declaration, or an older one, whose guide lacks that content receives a **harness-version finding** naming the upgrade path (run the `onboard` sub-skill in `upgrade` mode) — a finding, never a failure. A declared standard newer than this skill supports fails with an upgrade message.
- **Semantic limits (disclosed).** The mechanical layer checks structure: names, order, counts, links, headings, keywords. Whether a Touched Surface is *correct*, a scoped command *actually selects* the right tests, or a Final Review *actually reviewed* the diff is judged by reading — report those as manual review items with evidence, never as automatic passes.
- **Catalog matches disk.** Confirm `.agents/docs/` (the skills/agents catalog) lists exactly the skills, agents, and commands that exist under `.agents/` — no dead links, no missing entries.
- **Skill resolvable.** Confirm the DeepWorkPlan skill is installed or referenced so its sub-skills can be invoked.
- **Local reviewer present.** The AI Diff Reviewer local review (`../spec/ADDONS.md` §6.5) is part of the baseline since 2.3.0: the vendored skill at `.agents/skills/ai-diff-reviewer/` plus an extension file at a recognized path. Missing pieces are a **failure** for a repository declaring 2.3.0 or newer and a harness-version **finding** for a legacy one; a declared exception recorded in `AGENTS.md` is reported, not excused. The CI surface (`pr-review.yml`) is optional and never checked as required.

## Plan checks (when verifying a plan)

For each plan under `.dwp/plans/PLAN_{name}/`:

- Every task file declares an explicit scope, **acceptance criteria**, and at least one **validation gate** (a runnable command or check).
- **Test discipline.** Tasks that add new core functionality or change product behavior require automated test coverage in their Acceptance Criteria and run the repo's tests + lint/type-check in their Validation (`DWP_SPECIFICATION.md` §5.1.1). A behavior-changing plan with zero test work is a finding, not a pass.
- **Security discipline.** Tasks that touch auth, input handling, secrets/config, network surface, or dependencies carry security expectations in their Acceptance Criteria (`DWP_SPECIFICATION.md` §5.1.2); where the plan has a dedicated security-hardening task, it is ordered before the comprehensive-tests task.
- `PROGRESS.md` exists and is updated, so the plan is resumable.
- **Lifecycle shape (one of two, never mixed — `DWP_SPECIFICATION.md` §6, §6.5).** The plan's standard is read from its README `**Standard:**` line, else `manifest.json` `spec_version`, else it is legacy (`PLAN_STATE.md` §6.1). A **2.3.0** plan ends with exactly one `{N}.task_final_review*.md` as the last task, and that file names its parts — the security pass, final-state validation and skills reconciliation the checker requires of every such plan (its superset rule), plus the documentation reconciliation sweep the current standard adds — the filename alone proves nothing. A **legacy** plan ends with `security_review` (N-2), `skills_agents_discovery` (N-1), `executive_report` (N). A **declared migration** may keep an already-completed `security_review` as N-1 before the Final Review. Mixed, missing, duplicate or misordered final tasks fail; task ids must be unique and contiguous (sorted numerically — 10 comes after 9). A plan that declares a standard **newer** than this skill supports fails with an upgrade message and is **not** executed as legacy. On a completed plan, `analysis_results/SECURITY_REVIEW.md` exists and reports no unresolved critical finding.
- **Correspondence.** Every task file is referenced from the README and every README task link resolves; when the state layer is present, `state.json`'s `task_count`, unique numeric IDs and unique task entries match the files on disk one-to-one. Each task's completed status agrees with its README checkbox; `completed_count` and the README summary agree with those tasks. `Read Before Starting` references to nonexistent tasks are findings.
- **2.3.0 findings (never failures).** Tasks without a `Touched Surface` section (required for behavior-changing tasks; documentation/research tasks may state not applicable) and a missing `analysis_results/SKILLS_CANDIDATES.md` (acceptable until the first candidate exists — task logs may record `none`) are reported as findings. Legacy plans are not asked for either.
- Tasks re-anchor to the plan goal before executing.
- **State layer (when present).** `state.json` and `manifest.json` parse, and
  `state.json` agrees with the README checkboxes — on desync the markdown wins
  and the state file must be regenerated (`../spec/PLAN_STATE.md` §5).
  `conformance.sh` automates this. In a workspace without git
  (`../spec/ARCHETYPES.md` §4) the state layer is REQUIRED, not optional.

## Output

Produce a concise report:

```
DeepWorkPlan conformance — {repo name}

Repository
  [x] AGENTS.md (real Quick Commands)
  [x] CLAUDE.md -> AGENTS.md
  [ ] docs/ — missing SECURITY.md
  [x] .agents/ + catalog matches disk
  [x] .cursor -> .agents
  [x] .dwp/ gitignored (plans/)
  [x] tmp/ gitignored
  [x] skill resolvable

Verdict: NOT CONFORMANT — 1 issue.
Next: run /dwp-create "fix conformance gaps" to plan the remediation, then /dwp-execute.
```

End with one of: **CONFORMANT** (all MUST criteria pass) or **NOT CONFORMANT — N issue(s)**, listing each failure. If gaps exist, offer to capture the fixes as a Deep Work Plan with `/dwp-create` — do not fix them silently inside this read-only check.

> **Unsupported newer plan.** If a plan (or `AGENTS.md`) declares a DWP
> standard newer than this skill implements, the checker fails with an upgrade
> message. Do not execute such a plan as if it were legacy: upgrade the installed
> skill (`npx --yes skills add DailybotHQ/deepworkplan-skill@<newer tag> --skill deepworkplan -y`), then
> re-run `verify`.

> **Large repo / in-progress onboarding.** A big repo may be mid-onboarding via
> the plan-driven path (onboard Phase 2b) — its documentation is being generated
> task-by-task by an onboarding Deep Work Plan rather than all at once. If you
> find a `PLAN_onboard_*` under `.dwp/plans/`, report conformance gaps as
> **in progress, not failures**, and point the developer at `/dwp-status` and
> `/dwp-resume` to finish that plan rather than starting a new remediation plan.

### Interrupted finalization

A `.finalizing.json` marker is a failure, not an ignorable scratch file.
Verification remains read-only, including no Python bytecode output. Recover
through the execution finalization protocol after inspecting the marker and
workspace; never repair inside verify.
