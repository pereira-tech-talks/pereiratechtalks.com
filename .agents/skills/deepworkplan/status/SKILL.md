# DeepWorkPlan — Status

Report the current state of one or more Deep Work Plans — progress, completed
tasks, current task, checkpoint, blockers, consistency — **without executing or
modifying anything**, and without loading the whole plan.

## Shared resources (read these)

- [`../shared/context.sh`](../shared/context.sh) — resolve `dwp_dir`.
- [`../shared/dwp-paths.md`](../shared/dwp-paths.md) — plans at
  `.dwp/plans/<plan>/`.
- **Guide (essential — read for this flow):** none. Status is a read-only report; it does not load the methodology guide.

## Parameter Support

- `/dwp-status {plan_name}` — check a specific plan.
- `/dwp-status latest` — check the highest numbered plan, or the most recently modified legacy plan.
- `/dwp-status all` — check all plans.
- No parameter → interactive scope selection (Step 1).

Normalize the `PLAN_` prefix; validate that single plans exist under
`.dwp/plans/`. If not found, show available plans and ask the user to choose.

## Lite-aware status

For v2 plans report format, materialization, approval and promotion separately
from execution progress. Read them from `state.json`; fall back to the README's
`Approval` row when the field is absent, and to `pending` when neither is present. A ready pending-review Lite proposal is valid but not
executable. Resolve inline task locators against unique README anchors and count
only canonical task-index checkboxes, never fenced examples. Report a missing or
duplicate anchor, pending approval, or promotion marker as a finding; do not
repair it in this read-only flow.

## Trust boundary (write scope)

This skill is **read-only by contract**. `allowed-tools` lists `Bash` (which
Trust Hub treats as write-capable in general) — here it is used exclusively
for read-only inspection. Status reads plan folders, progress checkmarks, and
`state.json`, and reports; it performs no writes of any kind.

**It MUST NOT:** modify tasks, progress, `state.json` or source files; "fix" a
plan while reporting on it; or write anywhere. If the status reveals an
inconsistency, report it and point at `refine`/`resume` — do not repair it
silently.

## Workflow

### Step 0 — Check for Parameters
`all` → scope "all", skip to Step 2. Otherwise resolve the supplied full name,
ID, unique slug or `latest` with `../shared/plan_paths.py --plans-dir
<dwp_dir>/plans resolve <selector>`, set scope "single", then go to Step 2.
No parameter → Step 1.

### Step 1 — Ask for Scope
Use `../shared/plan_paths.py --plans-dir <dwp_dir>/plans list` to list plans;
the numbered folders appear in numeric order. `latest` is the highest plan ID
when numbered plans exist, or the most recently modified legacy plan otherwise.
Offer: a single plan (by ID or name), all plans, or `latest`.
Accept an ID, name, `all`, or `latest`.

Resolve a single selection with `../shared/plan_paths.py --plans-dir
<dwp_dir>/plans resolve <selector>`; accept full names, IDs and unique slugs.
If a slug is ambiguous, request the full name or ID.

### Step 2 — Gather Status Information (compact projection first)
**v6 plans first:** a plan folder with a `manifest.json` contract pointer,
`contract.json` or a `contracts/` chain is v6 — its records are the journal,
not `state.json`. Report from the shipped read-only commands, never by
re-deriving by hand: `python3 ../shared/ledger.py --plan <dir> inspect`
(events, one line each, torn tails reported); `python3
../shared/scheduler.py ready <dir>` (next dispatch, read-only);
`python3 ../shared/resources.py --plan <dir> report` / `routing` / `hold`
(envelope posture, incl. any exhaustion hold); `python3
../shared/outcomes.py --plan <dir> receipt` (recomputed outcome receipt —
it changes when the records change). Do **not** run `project` or
`views.py render` here — both write, and this flow stays read-only; the
`state.json` already on disk is a v6 projection and may be quoted with its
`generated_at` stamp, marked as derived. Status findings (torn tail, no
approval event, projection disagreement) are reported with their suggested
repair, never repaired. For a v7 plan, also run `python3 ../shared/ledger.py
--plan <dir> delegate observe` (read-only) and report each delegation's
task, transport, addon and state — a completed delegate is still
`asserted` until a gate observes it. Then continue with the README index and
consistency reading below (items 2–5 apply unchanged; item 1's
`state.json` is a v6 projection).

For each (non-v6) plan:
1. **State first.** If `state.json` exists, read it: `status`, `completed_count`
   / `task_count`, `checkpoint`, `blocked`, `updated_at`/`updated_by`, and the
   per-task `status` list. This is the compact projection; it is enough for the
   summary.
2. **README index.** Read the README's goal, `Plan Status` line, task list
   (`[x]`/`[ ]`, any `(re-validate…)` markers), `**Standard:**` line and
   pre-approval note. When there is no `state.json`, the README is the only
   source and the report says so.
3. **Consistency check** (`../spec/PLAN_STATE.md` §5): compare README checkboxes
   with `state.json` task statuses and `completed_count`; compare `[x]` tasks
   that carry a `commit` with `git log --oneline -20`; note a `checkpoint` whose
   task is `[x]`, a `blocked` entry on a `[x]` task, or a `task_count` that
   differs from the number of task files. Every disagreement is a **finding**
   (which tasks, which direction, markdown is authoritative) — never an edit.
4. **Targeted detail only.** Read the last completed task's Completion & Log and
   the current `[ ]` task file's title/goal; run `git status`. Do not read every
   task file or every gate record.
5. Compute totals and progress %.

**Enabled addons (any generation, read-only).** Run `python3
../shared/config.py enabled --plan <dir>` once per repository: it prints the
addon keys the repository's `.dwp/config.json` (over `~/.dwp/config.json`)
enables, one per line, and any fail-closed warning on stderr
(`../spec/CONFIG.md`). Report them as one line — `addons enabled: none` is
an ordinary answer, never a finding; the methodology works alone. Never
write the file from this flow.

### Step 3 — Generate Status Report

**Single plan:** header with the resolved plan basename and its actual location;
standard (and whether pre-approved for unattended
execution); goal; progress (total / completed / pending / %); completed tasks;
pending tasks; current status (last completed, next task, checkpoint note,
uncommitted work, recent commits); enabled addons (one line);
**blocked** (reason, since, needs) if set;
**consistency findings** if any, with the suggested action (`resume` to
reconcile, `refine` to fix structure); notes from the README; last task log
summary; whether an Executive Report was requested/produced.

**All plans:** a one-line-per-plan summary (progress, status, blocked?, last
activity), then the single-plan detail block for each.

### Step 4 — Additional Information (optional)
Offer deeper detail for any plan: all task files and status, `git diff` for
uncommitted changes, full last-task completion log, the gate records of one
task, any blockers.

### Step 5 — Quick Actions
Suggest: resume (`/dwp-resume <plan>`), execute (`/dwp-execute <plan>`),
refine (`/dwp-refine plan <plan>`), or open a specific task file.

## Status Classifications
Not started (all `[ ]`, no commits) · In progress (mixed, recent activity) ·
Complete (all `[x]`) · Blocked (`state.json.blocked` set or the current task's
log has a blocker note) · Stale (no activity for a long time — optional) ·
**Inconsistent** (any Step 2.3 finding — reported alongside the classification).

## Important Notes
- **Read-only:** never executes or modifies plans; `git status` is reported, not
  committed. Cross-reference the README task list with `state.json` and git
  commits for accuracy; the markdown is authoritative when they disagree.
- **Cheap by design:** the compact projection plus the README index answer the
  question; task files and logs are read only for the targeted detail above.

## Error Handling
- Plan folder doesn't exist → report; list available plans; ask to select.
- README missing, or README says `Plan Status: materializing` → report a partial
  materialization; read `manifest.json` (intended title and `task_count`) and
  the README task list when present and list which intended files exist and
  which are missing; suggest `/dwp-refine` (complete or discard) or
  `/dwp-create`. Never report it as executable.
- `state.json` unreadable or invalid → report it as a finding; fall back to the
  README; suggest `/dwp-resume` (which regenerates it).
- No plans exist → report "No plans found in `.dwp/plans/`"; suggest
  `/dwp-create`.
