"""v6 execution ledger: the append-only journal writer and snapshot projector.

Implements RFC section 4 (draft-4) for v6 new plans:

  * ``journal.ndjson`` — append-only event log, one closed object per line,
    validated by :mod:`contract_v6`. Events are never edited or deleted.
  * ``state.json`` — the deterministic snapshot projection: task statuses,
    criterion satisfaction, per-type journal positions, resource totals.
    Rebuilt only by this module, atomically (temp + rename + fsync); it is
    the recovery root, never the memory.

Write discipline (section 4.3, D2-1/D2-9c): a cooperative ``.ledger.lock``
directory serializes writers; a session whose journal grew behind its back
(an editor bypassing the writer) is refused at write time by the byte
position check — the collision is reported loudly on stderr and exits
nonzero, because a second append from the colliding session would itself
violate single-writer. A torn final line (crash mid-append) is repaired on
the next open-for-write: the incomplete tail is truncated and an explicit
``journal_repair`` event records the byte offset and cause.

Trust discipline (section 4.5, A1): the ``gate`` subcommand is the only
producer of ``observed`` records — the helper itself executes the command
with declared cwd, environment, timeout, and captured outputs. Everything
appended through ``append`` is written as the caller declares, and
``observed`` on a mediating (``agent``) actor is refused by
:mod:`contract_v6`; use ``asserted`` and name the mediation.

Evidence identity: run results are cached under a content fingerprint
(sha256 over the hashed inputs the check declared — task surface files,
command, cwd, env subset, toolchain, selection). ``reuse`` returns the
prior result only on an exact fingerprint match; a changed input is a new
fingerprint and can never reuse a stale result.

Stale evidence (D2-9b): a criterion only counts evidence recorded at or
after the task's ``task_start`` journal position, with a trust label the
criterion accepts. Boundary invariants are likewise evaluated at or after
task-start (D3-6); the projector refuses to count earlier items as
satisfying.

Durability (A10): ``export`` copies journal + snapshot + the full contract
chain to an operator-named destination with verified digests. ``roll``
archives the journal beside the plan (nothing is ever deleted;
snapshot-cited positions become archive-addressable, D2-8) and is OFF by
default — the default posture is export, not roll.

Python 3.9+ stdlib only. Never executes gates except via the explicit
``gate`` subcommand. Never edits or deletes journal events.
