# addons/ — Opt-In Addon Mechanism

This directory ships **inside** the DeepWorkPlan skill
(`skills/deepworkplan/addons/`). Four of the five addons here are **optional**
and **never** part of the AI-first baseline — one of them, **dependency
upgrade**, is **near-default**: offered for every repo with declared
dependencies, and its **inert** `/lib-upgrade` delegator installs under the
onboarding consent unless explicitly declined (an install runs no upgrade).
The fifth, the **AI Diff Reviewer local
review**, is a **required baseline component** since standard 2.3.0 (its CI
surface stays optional — see `ai-diff-reviewer/SPEC.md` §2). A repository is
fully conformant with **zero optional addons** installed. (Normative source:
`spec/ADDONS.md`.)

An **addon** is a self-contained, optional capability that the `onboard` flow
can layer onto a repo *after* the mandatory AI-first scaffolding
(`AGENTS.md` + `docs/` + per-module docs + `.agents/` + `.claude → .agents` +
`.cursor → .agents` + the DWP skill + `.dwp/`). Addons encode high-value best practices that the
audit found consistently across Dailybot repos but that a repo does **not** need
in order to be AI-first.

## The four rules every addon obeys

1. **Never required (one declared exception).** An optional addon MUST NOT be
   a precondition of baseline conformance; declining every optional addon
   still yields a fully AI-first repo. The AI Diff Reviewer's **local review**
   is the single declared exception: `spec/ADDONS.md` §6.5 places it in the
   baseline, and only its CI surface is opt-in.
2. **Reconcile, don't clobber.** When an accepted addon finds existing setup it
   would touch (an existing `.devcontainer/`, `docker/`, `.gitignore`,
   `.env.example`), it reconciles **additively** — preserving working values
   (ports, network names, env flags, project identity) and bringing the rest
   toward the addon standard. Any destructive change to an existing file
   requires explicit user approval (`AGENT_PROTOCOL.md`).
3. **Reason, don't copy-paste.** Like the rest of the methodology, an addon's
   templates are filled by **reasoning about the target repo's actual stack**,
   not by copying one reference repo's files verbatim. The *shape* is fixed; the
   *content* is adapted per repo. (One narrow exception: a piece so stable it is
   copied near-verbatim is explicitly flagged as such — e.g. the devcontainer
   AI-CLI persistence entrypoint.)
4. **Archetype-agnostic.** An addon MAY be layered onto either an individual
   repo or an orchestrator hub (`ARCHETYPES.md`); the addon's own spec says how
   each archetype differs.

## The addon contract — four mandatory components

Each addon is a subfolder here and MUST ship all four:

| Component | File(s) | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Spec** | `SPEC.md` | RFC-2119 description of what the addon provides and what "conformant to this addon" means. |
| **Reasoning templates** | `templates/*` | Parameterized guides with placeholders + decision notes the agent fills by reasoning about the repo's stack — not literal copies of one repo. |
| **Onboarding hook** | `SKILL.md` (`user-invocable`) | The entry point the `onboard` flow calls to offer, then (if accepted) apply the addon. Also directly invocable on an already-onboarded repo. |
| **Validation step** | A checklist inside `SPEC.md`/`SKILL.md` | Confirms the addon was applied correctly (files exist, settings present, smoke check passes). |

An addon MAY additionally ship per-stack presets, examples, or migration notes.

## How `onboard` discovers and applies addons

- **Discovery** — `onboard` installs the required AI Diff Reviewer local review
  in **Phase 7a**, then enumerates this directory (`../addons/`) and offers each
  optional addon in **Phase 7b**, after the core
  scaffolding (Phases 3–7).
- **Consent** — it never applies a signal-gated addon without user acceptance.
  In trust mode it MAY *recommend* the obviously-applicable ones, but still
  surfaces them. The **dependency-upgrade** addon is the one near-default
  exception: its **inert** `/lib-upgrade` delegator installs under the Phase 0
  onboarding consent unless explicitly declined, and no upgrade ever runs from
  an install.
- **Decline is safe** — declining an optional addon leaves a baseline-conformant repo; the required local-review baseline is handled separately in Phase 7a.
- **On accept** — `onboard` reads the addon's `SKILL.md`, runs its hook
  (reasoning about the detected stack), then runs its validation step.

## Addons

| Addon | Folder | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Devcontainer support | [`addons/devcontainer/`](devcontainer/SKILL.md) | **Authored** — compose-based `.devcontainer/` + `docker/` with AI-CLI persistence, `dailybot-project-network`, `DOCKER_DEV_ENV=vscode`, project-identity precedence, public-OSS variant, 7 reasoning presets. |
| Dailybot integration | [`addons/dailybot/`](dailybot/SKILL.md) | **Authored** — opt-in install of the Dailybot agent skill (**3.10.3**) / CLI (**>= 3.7.0**), auth **deferred** to the Dailybot skill's own consent flow, **four lifecycle events** (kickoff, significant task, blocked, completion) wired as optional best-effort reports via the `report` sub-skill, optional deterministic hook enforcement, and access to the full 14-capability Dailybot skill when invoked directly. The core methodology has **zero** Dailybot dependency. |
| Dependency upgrade | [`addons/dependency-upgrade/`](dependency-upgrade/SKILL.md) | **Authored** — **near-default**, **package-manager-agnostic** dependency upgrades: offered for every repo with declared dependencies, with the inert `/lib-upgrade` delegator installed under the onboarding consent unless explicitly declined (an install runs no upgrade). When invoked: detect the repo's real manager (npm/pnpm/yarn + ncu, pip/poetry/uv, cargo, go mod, bundler, composer…), classify by semver, upgrade in safe batches, run the repo's **real** validation gate after each batch, revert a failing batch, summarize. |
| Design system | [`addons/design-system/`](design-system/SKILL.md) | **Authored** — opt-in, **interface-surface-scoped** `DESIGN.md` at `docs/DESIGN.md` (indexed from `AGENTS.md`; root only if no `docs/` tree), covering three profiles in one file: **visual-ui** (design tokens from CSS vars / Tailwind config / token files / component styles; WCAG AA contrast), **cli-output** (semantic terminal styles, output components, TTY/`NO_COLOR` degradation), and **conversational** (voice & register, message anatomy, per-platform rendering with plain-text fallbacks). Reason about the repo's **real** design source — never a brand file — and reconcile an existing `DESIGN.md` instead of clobbering it. Offered by `onboard` **only when an interface surface is detected** — the offer is mandatory, not skippable, with the detection rationale recorded — and every profile (**visual-ui** strongly recommended) installs only after explicit acceptance, never auto-applied. |
| AI Diff Reviewer | [`addons/ai-diff-reviewer/`](ai-diff-reviewer/SKILL.md) | **Authored** — **required local review** (baseline since 2.3.0): tag-pinned install of the vendored `DailybotHQ/ai-diff-reviewer` skill (currently **v2.3.1**, marketplace listing "AI Diff Reviewer") plus a repo-tailored `.review/extension.md`, wired into the Final Review's security pass; the CI Action (Flow B — same prompt bytes as the local pass, methodology and severity parity) and the `apply-review` companion stay an explicit opt-in. |
