# Template — Dailybot Integration (reason, don't copy-paste)

Reasoning guidance for wiring the Dailybot addon into a target repo. This is
**not** a file to drop in verbatim — the commands and the doc wording are
**reasoned against the target repo** (its agent host, its real DWP execution
docs, whether it is public/private, whether a repo identity already exists).
Keep the SPEC contract intact: **opt-in, defer auth, never block,
reconcile-don't-clobber, vendor-neutral.**

---

## 1. Detect if Dailybot is already installed (reconcile-don't-clobber)

Run these **before** offering to install anything. Where a piece exists, do not
redo it — record it and only fill gaps.

```bash
# Is the Dailybot CLI on PATH?
command -v dailybot && dailybot --version 2>&1

# Is the Dailybot skill installed for this agent? (adjust the path to the host)
#   Claude Code: ~/.claude/skills/dailybot/   Cursor: ~/.cursor/skills/dailybot/
#   Codex: ~/.codex/skills/dailybot/          Gemini: ~/.gemini/skills/dailybot/
ls -d ~/.*/skills/dailybot 2>/dev/null

# Is a repo identity already committed?
ls .dailybot/profile.json .dailybot_example/profile.json 2>/dev/null

# Is auth already good? (only meaningful if the CLI is present — never prompt here)
command -v dailybot >/dev/null 2>&1 && dailybot status --auth 2>&1

# Has Dailybot been disabled for this repo? (respect the opt-out — send nothing)
ls .dailybot/disabled 2>/dev/null

# Are harness hooks already wired? (the command string is the uninstall marker)
grep -l 'dailybot hook' .claude/settings.json .agents/settings.json .cursor/hooks.json 2>/dev/null
```

Decision notes:

- **Skill present** → do not reinstall. Just verify the report step is wired.
- **CLI present but skill absent** → the integration still works; the report
  routes through the CLI (`dailybot agent update ... --milestone`). Offer the
  skill only if the developer wants the richer routing/writing guidance.
- **Identity present** → keep it. Never overwrite a working `profile.json`; never
  add a `key` field (credentials in that file are a hard error).
- **`.dailybot/disabled` present** → wire the step, but it stays silent for this
  repo by design. Note it; do not remove the file.

---

## 2. Install paths to OFFER (opt-in — never run without acceptance)

Let the developer choose; defer the verified CLI install + auth to the Dailybot
skill's own `shared/auth.md` flow.

| Want | Offer |
|------|-------|
| **Dailybot skill** (recommended — brings consent/auth + `report`) | `npx skills add DailybotHQ/agent-skill` · OpenClaw `openclaw skills install dailybot` · `git clone https://github.com/DailybotHQ/agent-skill.git` + `./setup.sh` |
| **Dailybot CLI only** (developer explicitly wants the binary) | `pip install 'dailybot-cli>=3.7.0'` (Py 3.10+) · `brew install dailybothq/tap/dailybot` (macOS) · vendor's verified installer flow (macOS / Linux / Windows) via [`shared/auth.md`](https://github.com/DailybotHQ/agent-skill/blob/main/skills/dailybot/shared/auth.md) — `download → verify SHA-256 → execute`, never a one-line remote-installer pipe |

> Prefer installing the **skill** — it owns the SHA-256-verified CLI install and
> the OTP/API-key auth flow. Only surface the raw CLI commands when the developer
> wants the CLI without the skill. Never recommend piping a remote installer to
> a shell (any variant of "fetch from the network and execute in one line") —
> use a package manager or the vendor's documented download-then-verify flow.

## 3. Auth — point at the Dailybot skill, do not reinvent

Do **not** prompt for email/OTP/API key, and do **not** store credentials. Tell
the developer the Dailybot skill drives this:

- `dailybot login` (email OTP), or `dailybot config key=...` / `DAILYBOT_API_KEY`.
- Full flow: the Dailybot skill's `shared/auth.md`. If they decline, skip
  reporting and continue.

---

## 4. Wire the plan lifecycle events into DWP execution

The integration value: the **plan lifecycle surfaces to the team** when
Dailybot is present (SPEC §5.1). Reason the exact wording for the repo, then
add a short, clearly-optional note to the repo's reporting docs (the generated
`AGENTS.md` reporting section and/or `docs/AI_AGENT_COLLAB.md`). The shape to
convey:

> **Optional — Dailybot reporting (best-effort, never blocks):** when the
> Dailybot skill/CLI is installed and authenticated, DWP work emits agent
> updates at four points — **kickoff** (plan approved: what is being built),
> **significant task** (a feature/fix ships mid-plan), **blocked** (the plan
> halts and `state.json.blocked` says what it needs), and **completion** (the
> only **milestone**: what was built). If Dailybot is absent, unauthenticated,
> or unreachable — or if `.dailybot/disabled` is present — skip silently and
> continue. Reporting MUST NOT block `create` or `execute`.

Reference command shapes (the actual content is reasoned from the work, not
templated; route through the `report` sub-skill when the skill is installed):

```bash
# Guard shared by every event — only when the CLI is present and authed.
if command -v dailybot >/dev/null 2>&1 && [ ! -f .dailybot/disabled ]; then

  # 1) Kickoff (regular) — plan materialized and approved
  dailybot agent update "Starting: <what is being built and why it matters>" \
    --json-data '{"completed":[],"in_progress":["<the goal, as an outcome>"],"blockers":[]}' \
    --metadata '{"model":"<your-model>","repo":"<repo>","branch":"<branch>"}' \
    || echo "Dailybot report skipped (non-blocking)."

  # 2) Significant task (regular) — a feature/fix shipped mid-plan
  dailybot agent update "<what shipped, in plain standup English>" \
    --json-data '{"completed":["<outcome>"],"in_progress":["<next outcome>"],"blockers":[]}' \
    || echo "Dailybot report skipped (non-blocking)."

  # 3) Blocked (regular, blockers populated) — derive from state.json.blocked
  dailybot agent update "<what is stuck and what it needs>" \
    --json-data '{"completed":["<done so far>"],"in_progress":[],"blockers":["<reason> — needs <needs>"]}' \
    || echo "Dailybot report skipped (non-blocking)."

  # 4) Completion (the only --milestone)
  dailybot agent update "<what was built, in plain standup English>" \
    --milestone \
    --json-data '{"completed":["..."],"in_progress":[],"blockers":[]}' \
    --metadata '{"model":"<your-model>","repo":"<repo>","branch":"<branch>"}' \
    || echo "Dailybot report skipped (non-blocking)."
fi
```

Decision notes:

- **Milestone vs regular:** plan completion → `--milestone`, and nothing else.
  Kickoff, significant tasks, and blocked are regular reports.
- **Payload from the state layer:** when the plan carries `state.json`
  (`PLAN_STATE.md`), derive `--json-data` from it — `completed` from completed
  tasks phrased as outcomes, `in_progress` from the current task, `blockers`
  from `state.json.blocked` (`reason`, `needs`). Without the state layer,
  derive from the plan README's checkboxes. Never maintain a separate progress
  ledger just for reporting.
- **One kickoff, one completion** per plan — re-runs and resumes do not
  re-announce the kickoff.
- **Writing rules:** describe outcomes + why, English, 1–3 sentences. Never
  "completed a plan", never file paths / git stats / branch names / plan IDs.
  Let the dailybot `report` sub-skill enforce the style.
- **Identity (optional):** commit `.dailybot/profile.json` (or the
  gitignore-friendly `.dailybot_example/profile.json` template) so every
  contributor/agent signs the same way — credential-free, no `key` field.
- **Reconcile:** if the repo's DWP docs already mention a report step, correct or
  keep it; do not duplicate it.

## 4b. Offer deterministic hook enforcement (CLI >= 3.7.0)

The §4 wiring is prompt-layer — it relies on the model remembering. When
`dailybot-cli` is **>= 3.7.0** (the unified floor for the current skill pack,
currently **3.10.3**), also offer (opt-in, show the exact config first) to commit
the repo-level harness hook config so the harness itself reminds the agent about
unreported work at end of turn:

```bash
# Version gate — only offer when the CLI meets the floor
dailybot --version          # >= 3.7.0 (hooks, chat, authoring, browse/read)
dailybot version --check      # confirms whether an upgrade is available
```

Reason against the repo, then merge (never overwrite) the config the Dailybot
skill's `report/hooks.md` documents — Claude Code `.claude/settings.json` (or
`.agents/settings.json` where `.claude → .agents`), Cursor `.cursor/hooks.json`
(or via `.cursor → .agents`),
other harnesses per its table. Decision notes:

- **Defer the mechanics** — templates, output formats (`--format claude|cursor|generic`),
  auto-activation triggers (`report/triggers.md`), anti-noise gates, and uninstall
  all live in the Dailybot skill's `report/hooks.md`; do not duplicate them into
  the repo docs.
- **No double-reporting by construction:** every successful
  `dailybot agent update` (any §4 lifecycle event) resets the hook ledger.
  The hooks are the deterministic backstop for a missed lifecycle event.
- **Document the response contract** in the repo's reporting note: a hook
  reminder is answered with a report (if a meaningful unit is done) or
  `dailybot hook dismiss` (if not) — never ignored silently, never blocking.
- **Committed policy knobs** live in `.dailybot/profile.json`:
  `"report": {"min_interval_minutes": 30, "nudge": false}` turns reminders off
  for the repo while keeping manual reporting; `"mode": "continuous"` nudges
  non-commit work (research, docs, plans) sooner in research-heavy repos.
- **Older CLI:** below 3.7.0 → skip the offer, suggest `dailybot upgrade` once,
  and let the §4 wiring stand alone.

---

## 5. Consent + never-block rules (do not violate)

- **Opt-in:** install nothing, write no identity, and commit no hook config
  without explicit acceptance.
- **Defer auth:** never prompt for or store credentials; point at the Dailybot
  skill's `shared/auth.md`.
- **Verified install only:** never recommend piping a remote installer to a
  shell without the skill's checksum/consent verification. Prefer a package
  manager (`pip`, `brew`) or the skill's documented `download → verify SHA-256
  → execute` flow — never a one-line `fetch-and-execute` pipe.
- **Never block:** the wired report step is best-effort; absence, auth failure,
  network errors, or `.dailybot/disabled` mean skip-and-continue — warn once, no
  retries, no diagnostic loop. `execute` always succeeds regardless.
- **Vendor-neutral:** never imply DWP requires Dailybot. A repo with zero addons
  is fully conformant.
