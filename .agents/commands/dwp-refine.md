## What to do

Route this invocation to the **refine** sub-skill of the installed `deepworkplan`
skill and follow it: read `.agents/skills/deepworkplan/refine/SKILL.md` and
execute its flow. Plan and draft outputs land in this repo's gitignored `.dwp/`
(`.dwp/plans/`, `.dwp/drafts/`).

> Other agents: invoke the skill's `deepworkplan-refine` sub-skill directly
> (`/deepworkplan-refine` in Claude Code, `#deepworkplan-refine` elsewhere). This
> `dwp-refine` file is the shorter, conventional alias.
