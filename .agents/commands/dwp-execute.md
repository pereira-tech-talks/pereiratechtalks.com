# /dwp-execute — provided by the `deepworkplan` skill

## What to do

Route this invocation to the **execute** sub-skill of the installed `deepworkplan`
skill and follow it: read `.agents/skills/deepworkplan/execute/SKILL.md` and
execute its flow. Plan and draft outputs land in this repo's gitignored `.dwp/`
(`.dwp/plans/`, `.dwp/drafts/`).

> Other agents: invoke the skill's `deepworkplan-execute` sub-skill directly
> (`/deepworkplan-execute` in Claude Code, `#deepworkplan-execute` elsewhere).
> This `dwp-execute` file is the shorter, conventional alias.
